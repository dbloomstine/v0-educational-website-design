# OpenGraph Image Required

## What You Need

Create a social sharing image for OpenGraph and Twitter Cards:

- **Filename**: `og-image.png`
- **Location**: Place in `/public/og-image.png`
- **Dimensions**: 1200px × 630px
- **Format**: PNG or JPG
- **File size**: Under 1MB for optimal loading

## Design Recommendations

### Content to Include:
- **FundOps logo/branding**
- **Tagline**: "Fund Operations Resources for Investment Professionals"
- **Visual elements**: Consider clean, professional design with:
  - Fund type icons or representations
  - Professional color scheme (match site colors)
  - Minimal text for readability

### Design Tips:
- Keep text large and readable (minimum 60px font size)
- Use high contrast for visibility in social feeds
- Center important content (outer 10% may be cropped on some platforms)
- Test on both light and dark backgrounds
- Avoid small details that won't be visible when scaled down

## Tools for Creation

- **Canva**: Free templates for social media images
- **Figma**: Professional design tool
- **Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator**: If you have access
- **Online generators**: Many free OG image generators available

## Testing

After creating the image:
1. Place in `/public/og-image.png`
2. Test with:
   - **Twitter Card Validator**: https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator
   - **Facebook Sharing Debugger**: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/
   - **LinkedIn Post Inspector**: https://www.linkedin.com/post-inspector/

## Current Status

⚠️ **PLACEHOLDER NEEDED**: The site currently references `/og-image.png` in metadata but the file doesn't exist yet.

Once created, the image will automatically be used for:
- Twitter/X shares
- LinkedIn shares
- Facebook shares
- Other social platforms that support OpenGraph
