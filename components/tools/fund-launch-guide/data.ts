    title: 'Define your investment thesis',
    quickTip: 'Articulate what you invest in, why, and what makes your approach differentiated.',
    fullExplanation: `Your investment thesis is the foundation of everything. It should clearly explain: (1) the market opportunity you're pursuing, (2) your specific strategy for capturing returns, (3) why you and your team are uniquely positioned to execute, and (4) what differentiates you from competitors. LPs will scrutinize this heavily—a vague or generic thesis is a red flag.`,

    id: 'strategy-fund-size',
    phaseId: 'strategy',
    title: 'Determine target fund size',
    quickTip: 'Your fund size should align with your strategy, check sizes, and realistic LP demand.',
    fullExplanation: `Fund size isn't aspirational—it needs to be justified by your strategy. Consider: typical investment size × number of investments = minimum fund size. Also factor in management fee math (can you run the firm on 2% of target?), your realistic LP pipeline, and market benchmarks for funds with your strategy. First-time funds typically raise $50-150M for VC, $100-300M for PE.`,

    id: 'strategy-gp-commitment',
    phaseId: 'strategy',
    title: 'Plan your GP commitment',
    quickTip: 'Most LPs expect 1-5% GP commitment; emerging managers often commit 2-3%.',
    fullExplanation: `GP commitment signals skin in the game and alignment with LPs. The standard range is 1-5% of fund size. First-time managers often need to stretch to show commitment. Consider: personal liquidity, management fee offset structures, and whether you'll fund via cash or fee waiver. Some LPs have hard minimums—institutional LPs often want to see at least 1%.`,

    title: 'Finalize your team structure',
    quickTip: 'Define who the GPs are, their economics, and key operational roles.',
    fullExplanation: `LPs invest in teams, not just strategies. Clarify: Who are the GPs and their ownership %? Who has carry and in what proportions? Do you need operating partners or advisors? How will investment decisions be made? Document this early—changing GP economics later causes major complications with fund documents and LP relationships.`,

    title: 'Set fund economics (fees & carry)',
    quickTip: 'Standard terms are 2% management fee and 20% carried interest, but there are many variations.',
    fullExplanation: `Fund economics include: management fee (typically 1.5-2.0% of commitments during investment period, then lower on invested capital), carried interest (typically 20%), preferred return/hurdle (commonly 8% for PE, less common for VC), GP catch-up provisions, and fee offsets for deal fees or monitoring fees. Research market standards for your strategy and size.`,

    title: 'Select and engage fund counsel',
    quickTip: 'Your fund lawyer is one of your most important relationships—choose carefully.',
    fullExplanation: `Fund counsel will draft your core documents, advise on structure, and guide you through regulatory requirements. Look for: experience with your fund type and size, reasonable fees for emerging managers, responsiveness, and willingness to educate. Get fee estimates upfront—first fund formation typically costs $75-150K for legal alone. Ask for references from other emerging managers.`,
    pitfalls: [

    phaseId: 'legal-formation',
    title: 'Choose fund jurisdiction and structure',
    quickTip: 'Delaware LP is standard for US funds; offshore structures add complexity but may be needed for certain LPs.',
    fullExplanation: `Most US funds are Delaware LPs (simple, well-understood). You may need parallel structures for: tax-exempt investors (to avoid UBTI), non-US investors (withholding/tax treaty benefits), or ERISA considerations. Common structures include Delaware LP + Cayman feeder, or Delaware LP + blocker corporations. Your counsel will advise based on your target LP base.`,
    pitfalls: [
      'Over-engineering structure for a first fund',

    id: 'legal-gp-entity',
    phaseId: 'legal-formation',
    title: 'Form GP entity (General Partner)',
    quickTip: 'The GP entity manages the fund and takes on liability—usually a Delaware LLC.',
    fullExplanation: `The General Partner entity is the legal entity that manages the fund, makes investment decisions, and has unlimited liability for fund obligations. Typically structured as a Delaware LLC. This is separate from the Management Company (which employs staff and receives fees). Operating agreement should address: member composition, voting rights, removal provisions, and fiduciary duties.`,
    pitfalls: [

    phaseId: 'legal-formation',
    title: 'Form Management Company',
    quickTip: 'The Management Company employs staff and receives management fees—keep it separate from the GP.',
    fullExplanation: `The Management Company (also a Delaware LLC typically) employs investment professionals, receives management fees, and handles operating expenses. Keeping it separate from the GP provides liability protection and cleaner economics. The operating agreement should address: ownership, profit allocation, expense allocation across multiple funds, and employment matters.`,
    pitfalls: [
      'Commingling GP and Management Company',

    title: 'Form Fund LP entity',
    quickTip: 'This is the actual fund—the Delaware LP that will hold investments and have LPs.',
    fullExplanation: `The Fund LP is the investment vehicle itself. It's typically a Delaware Limited Partnership with the GP entity as General Partner and investors as Limited Partners. The Certificate of Limited Partnership is filed with Delaware Secretary of State. The detailed terms are in the Limited Partnership Agreement (LPA), which comes later in the documentation phase.`,
    pitfalls: [

    title: 'Form offshore/parallel vehicles (if needed)',
    quickTip: 'Cayman feeders or blockers may be needed for tax-exempt or non-US investors.',
    fullExplanation: `Offshore structures are typically needed when: you have tax-exempt LPs who need UBTI protection, non-US investors seeking tax treaty benefits, or significant expected deal flow generating ECI. Common structures include Cayman Islands LP as parallel fund or feeder, or blocker corporations. Add $30-50K+ to legal costs and ongoing Cayman registered office fees.`,
    pitfalls: [
      'Building offshore structure speculatively',
      'Underestimating ongoing compliance costs',

    phaseId: 'documentation',
    title: 'Draft Limited Partnership Agreement (LPA)',
    quickTip: 'The LPA is your fund constitution—it governs everything from fees to distributions to LP rights.',
    fullExplanation: `The LPA is the most important fund document. Key provisions include: capital commitments and calls, management fee calculation, carried interest and waterfall, distribution mechanics, investment restrictions, LP advisory committee rights, key person provisions, removal/termination rights, and reporting requirements. Expect multiple drafts and significant LP negotiation.`,
    pitfalls: [
      'Copying another fund LPA without understanding implications',
      'Not stress-testing provisions under different scenarios',
      'Being too aggressive on GP-favorable terms (LPs will push back)',

    id: 'docs-ppm',
    phaseId: 'documentation',
    title: 'Draft Private Placement Memorandum (PPM)',
    quickTip: 'The PPM is your disclosure document—it describes the fund and its risks to prospective investors.',
    fullExplanation: `The PPM is a securities law disclosure document that describes: the fund strategy, team bios, terms summary, risk factors, tax considerations, ERISA implications, and regulatory status. It protects the GP by ensuring investors are informed. Quality matters—sophisticated LPs will scrutinize this. Include comprehensive risk factors even if they seem obvious.`,
    pitfalls: [

    quickTip: 'Subscription docs collect investor information and their commitment to invest.',
    fullExplanation: `Subscription documents include: the subscription agreement (investor's commitment and representations), investor questionnaire (accreditation verification, AML/KYC info, tax status), and signature pages. These must comply with securities laws and collect enough info for your compliance obligations. Many funds now use electronic subscription platforms like Anduin or DocuSign.`,

    title: 'Develop side letter framework',
    quickTip: 'Large LPs will request special terms via side letters—have a framework ready.',
    fullExplanation: `Side letters grant specific LPs modifications to standard terms. Common requests include: fee discounts, MFN (most favored nation) provisions, co-investment rights, enhanced reporting, excuse rights from certain investments, and confidentiality carve-outs. Develop a framework of what you will/won't grant. Be careful—side letters create operational complexity and potential LP conflicts.`,

    title: 'Determine SEC registration exemptions',
    quickTip: 'Most emerging managers rely on the private fund adviser exemption or exempt reporting adviser status.',
    fullExplanation: `Under the Investment Advisers Act, you likely need to either: (1) register as an RIA if AUM exceeds thresholds, (2) rely on the private fund adviser exemption (US assets < $150M), or (3) file as an exempt reporting adviser (ERA). Your fund counsel will analyze based on expected AUM, investor types, and strategy. This determines your regulatory obligations going forward.`,

    quickTip: 'Form ADV is your SEC registration or reporting document—even ERAs must file a shortened version.',
    fullExplanation: `Form ADV has two parts: Part 1 (regulatory information, filed electronically via IARD) and Part 2 (narrative brochure for clients). Registered advisers file both; ERAs file only Part 1. Part 2A (the "brochure") must be delivered to investors and describes your business, fees, conflicts, and disciplinary history.

    fullExplanation: `Your compliance manual documents policies for: personal trading, material non-public information, conflicts of interest, allocation policies, valuation, custody, advertising, and recordkeeping. Don't just buy a template—customize it to your actual operations. You'll also need a designated Chief Compliance Officer (can be outsourced for smaller funds).`,

Key elements: personal securities transaction reporting, pre-clearance requirements, restricted lists, gift and entertainment policies, political contributions, and outside business activities. All access persons must acknowledge the code annually and report violations.`,

    fullExplanation: `Most institutional LPs require audited financials. Select an auditor with: fund audit experience (especially your fund type), reasonable fees for emerging managers, familiarity with your fund admin, and capacity to meet your timeline. Big 4 firms are prestigious but expensive; mid-tier fund specialists (RSM, EisnerAmper, WithumSmith+Brown) often provide better value for emerging managers.`,

    quickTip: 'Subscription lines smooth capital calls and can enhance IRR—but LPs scrutinize usage carefully.',
    fullExplanation: `Subscription credit facilities (capital call facilities) are secured by LP commitments and allow funds to: bridge capital calls, smooth LP cash flows, and potentially enhance IRR (controversial). Key terms: facility size (typically 20-30% of commitments), interest rate (SOFR + spread), advance rates by LP type, and borrowing base calculations. LPs increasingly want limits on usage and clear disclosure of IRR impact.`,
