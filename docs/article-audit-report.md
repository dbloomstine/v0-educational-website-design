## Medium Priority Issues

### 1. Paragraph Length Inconsistency (~35 articles)

- Some paragraphs exceed 200 words (should be 100-150)
- Creates wall-of-text effect
- **Fix**: Break long paragraphs at logical points

### 2. Heading Structure Variance (~25 articles)

- Target: 8-12 H2 sections with 2-4 H3 subsections each
- Some articles have only 2-3 H2 sections
- **Fix**: Add more structure with subheadings

### 3. Data Buried in Prose (~25 articles)

- Numbers, percentages, and examples embedded in paragraphs
- Should be extracted to lists or tables
- **Fix**: Convert numerical data to structured formats

### 4. HTML Structure Inconsistency

- Some articles use `<article>` and `<section>` wrappers
- Others use bare `<p>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>` tags
- **Fix**: Standardize to clean structure without wrapper tags

---

## Low Priority (Nice to Have)

1. Add internal cross-references between related articles
2. Create comparison tables for complex concepts
3. More specific, detailed numerical examples
4. Verify reading times are calculated consistently

---

## Common Patterns (Batch-Fixable)

### Pattern 1: External Links (GOOD)

- All articles have 6-8 links to authoritative sources (SEC, IRS, ILPA, etc.)
- Consistent and appropriate

### Pattern 2: Tool References (GOOD)

- ~70 articles reference relevant tools contextually
- All tool links work correctly

### Pattern 3: Takeaways Format (GOOD)

- Most articles have 8-10 bullet-point takeaways
- Bold introductory phrases followed by explanations

### Pattern 4: Title Length (NEEDS ATTENTION)

- Some titles exceed 120 characters
- Consider slightly shorter titles for metadata

---

## Recommended Fixes by Priority

### IMMEDIATE

1. Expand underdeveloped articles to minimum 250 lines
2. Standardize HTML structure (remove unnecessary wrappers)
3. Ensure 8-12 H2 sections in each article

### MEDIUM

1. Break up dense paragraphs (target 100-150 words)
2. Extract data to structured formats
3. Verify reading time calculations

### LOW

1. Add cross-references
2. Create comparison tables
3. Polish titles for metadata
