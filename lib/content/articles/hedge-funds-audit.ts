  content: `<p>Annual financial statement audits are a fundamental requirement for most hedge funds, providing independent verification that supports investor confidence and regulatory compliance. SEC-registered investment advisers managing private funds must generally have those funds audited annually by an independent auditor registered with the PCAOB. Beyond regulatory requirements, institutional investors typically require audited financial statements as a condition of investment, and fund documents often mandate annual audits regardless of regulatory status.</p>

<h2>Regulatory Audit Requirements</h2>
<p>The SEC's custody rule creates the primary regulatory driver for hedge fund audits. Registered investment advisers with custody of client assets must either undergo an annual surprise examination or have the private funds they manage audited annually. Most hedge fund managers choose the audit path, as it aligns with investor expectations and provides more comprehensive verification.</p>

<p>The audit must be conducted by an independent public accountant registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The auditor must issue an opinion on the fund's financial statements and deliver audited financials to investors within 120 days of fiscal year-end. Failure to meet these requirements can result in regulatory action against the adviser.</p>

<p>Even exempt reporting advisers who do not register with the SEC often face audit requirements through fund documentation or LP demands. Institutional investors generally expect audited financials regardless of the manager's regulatory status.</p>

<h2>Auditor Selection</h2>
<p>Choosing an auditor involves balancing multiple considerations. Experience with hedge funds specifically matters—the valuation challenges, trading volumes, and fee structures differ from other fund types. An auditor familiar with hedge fund accounting will conduct the engagement more efficiently and identify issues more effectively.</p>

<p>The major accounting firms offer deep resources and institutional credibility that some LPs prefer. Mid-sized and specialized firms may provide more personalized service and competitive pricing while still meeting LP expectations. The appropriate choice depends on fund complexity, LP requirements, and service priorities.</p>

<p>Independence requirements constrain auditor selection. Auditors providing certain non-audit services or having relationships with the fund, manager, or key service providers may face independence concerns. Evaluating independence early in selection prevents problems during the engagement.</p>

<h2>Hedge Fund Audit Focus Areas</h2>
<p>Several aspects of hedge fund operations receive particular audit attention.</p>

<p>Valuation represents the most significant audit focus area. Hedge funds hold diverse instruments—some trading on exchanges with observable prices, others requiring significant judgment to value. Auditors test the fund's valuation policies, examine pricing sources, evaluate broker quotes, and assess whether fair value conclusions are reasonable. Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements under ASC 820 receive heightened scrutiny.</p>

<p>Trading activity and transaction testing involves sampling trades for accuracy, proper recording, and settlement. High-volume trading creates audit challenges—auditors cannot test every transaction but must achieve reasonable assurance about accuracy. Organized records and reconciled systems facilitate efficient testing.</p>

<p>Performance fee calculations receive careful audit attention given their complexity. Auditors verify high water mark tracking, hurdle rate applications, and crystallization mechanics. Errors in performance fees directly affect investor returns and manager compensation, making accuracy essential.</p>

<h2>The Audit Process</h2>
<p>Annual audits typically follow a structured timeline:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Planning:</strong> The auditor assesses risks, develops audit procedures, and identifies focus areas. Understanding strategy changes, new instruments, or operational modifications helps tailor the approach.</li>
<li><strong>Interim Procedures:</strong> Some testing occurs before year-end, particularly around controls and processes. Interim work identifies issues early and spreads workload.</li>
<li><strong>Year-End Fieldwork:</strong> Intensive testing occurs after year-end close. Auditors verify positions, test valuations, examine fee calculations, and assess financial statement presentation.</li>
<li><strong>Completion:</strong> Resolution of identified issues, management representation letter, and final review precede opinion issuance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Audit Deliverables</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Audited Financial Statements:</strong> The primary output including balance sheet, statement of operations, changes in partners' capital, and cash flows</li>
<li><strong>Auditor's Opinion:</strong> The auditor's conclusion on whether financials present fairly under GAAP</li>
<li><strong>Schedule of Investments:</strong> Detailed listing of portfolio holdings at fair value</li>
<li><strong>Notes to Financial Statements:</strong> Required disclosures about accounting policies, fair value measurements, and other matters</li>
<li><strong>Management Letter:</strong> Communication of control deficiencies or other observations, if any</li>
</ul>

<h2>Working with Auditors</h2>
<p>Efficient audits require coordination among the manager, administrator, prime broker, and auditor. The administrator typically prepares draft financial statements and trial balances. The manager provides valuation support, transaction documentation, and management representations. Prime brokers confirm positions and provide transaction records.</p>

<p>Organizing documentation throughout the year supports audit efficiency. Valuation memos explaining pricing decisions, reconciliations tying to service provider records, and organized transaction files reduce auditor requests and accelerate the process.</p>

<p>Communication during the audit helps address issues promptly. Regular status calls, clear escalation paths for questions, and responsive document production keep the engagement on schedule.</p>

<h2>Questions for Audit Relationships</h2>
<ul>
<li>Does the auditor have specific experience with our strategy and instrument types?</li>
<li>What is the expected timeline, and how will the 120-day deadline be met?</li>
<li>How will valuation procedures be conducted, especially for less liquid positions?</li>
<li>Who will be assigned to the engagement, and what is the team's relevant experience?</li>
<li>How does the auditor coordinate with our administrator and prime broker?</li>
<li>What fee structure applies, and what might cause additional charges?</li>
