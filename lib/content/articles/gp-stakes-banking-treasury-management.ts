  content: `<p>GP-stakes treasury management involves coordinating acquisition financing for management company purchases given large transaction sizes, processing distributions from management fees and carried interest with varying frequency and amounts, maintaining liquidity for potential follow-on investments or operational support to portfolio GPs, and forecasting cash flows considering fee predictability versus carry uncertainty. The CFO establishes banking relationships supporting acquisition facilities, implements distribution processing across multiple portfolio GPs, and optimizes cash management balancing liquidity needs against return drag.</p>

<h2>Acquisition Financing</h2>

<p>GP stakes typically require substantial initial investments often financed partially with subscription lines. Facilities enable completing acquisitions promptly while managing investor capital call frequency. The CFO negotiates subscription line terms including borrowing base calculations typically based on uncalled commitments, advance rates ranging from 80-100% of eligible commitments, interest rates benchmarked to SOFR plus spreads, and covenant requirements monitoring fund metrics and operations. Acquisition financing provides deployment flexibility matching opportunities while controlling investor capital call frequency improving LP experience.</p>

<h2>Distribution Management</h2>

<p>GP-stakes receive distributions from portfolio GPs with varying characteristics. Management fee distributions occur quarterly providing relatively predictable cash flow, carried interest distributions from fund realizations arrive episodically with significant variability, and proceeds from stake sales or refinancings occur opportunistically. The CFO processes distributions tracking sources and amounts, allocates cash to investors per fund terms which may include preferred returns or tiered economics, handles reinvestment decisions when distributions exceed fund obligations, and reports cash flow activity to investors showing income versus realization proceeds. Efficient distribution processing ensures timely investor payments and accurate characterization for reporting.</p>

<h2>Cash Flow Forecasting</h2>

<p>Predicting GP-stakes cash flows requires modeling multiple components. Management fee projections use AUM levels and fee rates providing relatively stable baseline, carried interest forecasts consider portfolio fund maturity and expected realizations introducing significant uncertainty, operating capital needs assess potential requirements for follow-on investments or portfolio GP support, and investor distribution obligations factor preferred returns and pacing targets. The CFO maintains rolling forecasts updating assumptions based on portfolio GP business developments, fundraising progress, and realization activity. Forecasting enables proactive liquidity management and informs capital call planning.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Acquisition financing enables deployment flexibility:</strong> Subscription lines allow closing purchases promptly while managing investor capital call frequency and experience.</li>

<li><strong>Distribution sources vary significantly:</strong> Quarterly fee distributions provide stability while episodic carry realization creates variability requiring flexible cash management.</li>

<li><strong>Forecasting combines stability and uncertainty:</strong> Management fees are predictable while carried interest depends on portfolio fund realizations introducing complexity.</li>

<li><strong>Liquidity needs include follow-on investments:</strong> Maintaining reserves for additional portfolio GP investments or support provides strategic flexibility enhancing partnership value.</li>
