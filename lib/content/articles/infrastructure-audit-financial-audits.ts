  content: `<p>Infrastructure fund audits present unique challenges from DCF valuation methodologies requiring 20-40 year cash flow projection testing, regulatory accounting for utilities following specialized principles, project finance debt complexity with multiple tranches and covenants, and revenue recognition for long-term contracts or regulated frameworks. Auditors must understand infrastructure economics, regulatory environments, and asset-specific operational considerations beyond traditional private equity audit expertise.</p>

<h2>Valuation Testing</h2>

<p>DCF valuation audit procedures include reviewing cash flow projection methodologies and key assumptions, testing discount rate appropriateness considering asset risk profiles, evaluating terminal value calculations, and assessing sensitivity analysis around key variables. Auditors may engage valuation specialists for complex assets or engage independent appraisers for supplemental valuation evidence. Material valuation changes require explanation with supporting evidence from operational performance, regulatory developments, or market condition changes. The CFO maintains comprehensive valuation documentation including models, assumption support, and comparable transaction evidence facilitating auditor review.</p>

<h2>Regulatory Accounting Review</h2>

<p>Regulated utilities follow specialized accounting creating deferred regulatory assets and liabilities not recognized under GAAP. Auditors test regulatory accounting application, review rate case outcomes supporting deferral authorization, and evaluate collectability of regulatory assets through future rate recovery. Understanding regulatory frameworks and rate-making principles becomes essential for effective audit procedures. The CFO coordinates with regulatory accountants and external advisors ensuring audit teams receive appropriate regulatory accounting education and documentation.</p>

<h2>Debt and Covenant Testing</h2>

<p>Complex project finance with multiple debt tranches, reserves, and covenants requires comprehensive testing. Auditors obtain debt confirmations from lenders, test covenant compliance calculations, review debt service reserve adequacy, and evaluate interest rate hedge accounting. Covenant violations or near-violations require disclosure and assessment of going concern implications. The CFO maintains detailed debt schedules, covenant calculations, and lender correspondence supporting audit testing.</p>

<h2>Revenue Recognition for Contracts and Regulation</h2>

<p>Long-term contracts and regulated revenues create recognition complexities. Auditors test contract term compliance, evaluate rate regulation application, assess collectability, and examine revenue recognition timing. The CFO provides contract documentation, rate case orders, and collection histories supporting revenue recognition testing.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>DCF valuation drives audit focus:</strong> Twenty to forty year projection testing, discount rate assessment, and terminal value evaluation dominate infrastructure audit procedures given valuation methodology reliance on DCF.</li>

<li><strong>Regulatory accounting requires specialized expertise:</strong> Utility regulatory frameworks create accounting complexities requiring auditor education and comprehensive documentation from fund management.</li>

<li><strong>Project finance adds debt complexity:</strong> Multiple tranches, covenant calculations, reserves, and hedging create comprehensive debt testing requirements beyond simpler financing structures.</li>

<li><strong>Year-round documentation facilitates audits:</strong> Comprehensive valuation files, regulatory accounting support, and debt tracking enable efficient audit completion without year-end information scrambles.</li>
