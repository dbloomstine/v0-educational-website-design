  content: `<p>Venture capital funds operate where investment decisions move from term sheet to closing in weeks, and competitive dynamics demand wiring millions on short notice. VC fund treasury operations must balance speed, security, and scalability as portfolios grow across multiple stages and geographies. Fund managers should model their capital needs using the <a href="/tools/management-company-budget">Management Company Budget Planner</a> to ensure adequate liquidity.</p>

<h2>Banking Relationship Selection</h2>

<p>VC funds select banking partners based on execution speed, subscription line flexibility, international wire capabilities, and relationship teams that understand compressed venture timelines.</p>

<p>Early-stage VC funds ($50M-$250M) typically work with one or two banks providing both operating accounts and subscription facilities. Emerging managers often find specialized fund finance boutiques or regional banks offer more attentive service and competitive pricing than bulge bracket institutions.</p>

<p>Growth equity funds ($500M-$2B) maintain relationships with two to four banks, including at least one with strong international capabilities. Multi-stage platforms operating multiple vehicles (e.g., a $150M seed fund, $500M early-stage fund, and $1.5B growth fund) often consolidate relationships at the firm level through master agreements while maintaining required legal separation.</p>

<p>Funds with international strategies require banking partners with efficient cross-border wire capabilities, competitive FX pricing, and ideally local branch networks for time-zone-appropriate service.</p>

<h2>Account Structure for High Transaction Velocity</h2>

<p>VC funds process dozens or hundreds of transactions monthly, including initial investments, follow-on financings, pro-rata participations, bridge notes, and SAFE conversions. Early-stage funds often maintain a single primary operating account, with treasury teams using transaction coding systems to categorize wires by portfolio company, round, and type.</p>

<p>Subscription facility accounts operate under controlled disbursement arrangements with lender security interests. Proceeds flow into pledged accounts, ensuring capital called to repay borrowings reaches the lender.</p>

<p>Multi-currency accounts reduce conversion costs of 50-100 basis points per transaction. A fund making regular European investments might maintain €5M-€10M, replenishing through bulk conversions at better pricing.</p>

<p>Distribution accounts separate operating activities from LP distributions, simplifying audits for funds with complex waterfalls or multiple share classes.</p>

<h2>Subscription Lines for Rapid Deployment</h2>

<p>Subscription facilities provide liquidity to move quickly on competitive investments without emergency capital calls. Facility sizing typically ranges from 15-25% of total commitments. A $200M seed fund might establish a $40M facility (20%), enabling 10-20 seed investments before calling capital. A $750M growth fund might establish $150M (20%) supporting 3-5 large investments plus follow-ons. The <a href="/tools/subscription-credit-line">Subscription Credit Line Calculator</a> helps model facility sizing and its impact on fund returns.</p>

<p>VC funds maintain more continuous, moderate utilization versus lumpy buyout borrowing. A fund might keep $15M-$30M drawn continuously, calling capital quarterly to repay and reset capacity. Venture facilities often include same-day draw sublimits for competitive situations where funds must wire within hours.</p>

<p>Borrowing bases include only commitments from LPs meeting creditworthiness thresholds: 100% borrowing against endowments, public pensions, and highly rated insurers; 50-75% against other institutionals; often excluding individual commitments entirely. <a href="https://ilpa.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ILPA</a> provides guidance on subscription facility disclosure best practices.</p>

<p>Pricing runs SOFR plus 150-275 basis points, with established managers commanding tighter spreads. All-in annual cost including unused commitment and arrangement fees: 2.5-4.0%.</p>

<h2>Rapid Wire Execution</h2>

<p>Hot deals in competitive segments (AI, fintech, healthcare tech) often compress closing timelines from 3-4 weeks to 7-10 days. Funds that cannot execute quickly risk losing allocation or missing opportunities when founders select investors partly on execution certainty.</p>

<p>Required banking capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Same-day wire processing with late-day cutoffs</li>
<li>Relationship bankers with authority to expedite seven-figure transfers</li>
<li>After-hours support with mobile contact for weekend/evening closings</li>
<li>Efficient SWIFT processing for international wires</li>
</ul>

<p>Most funds establish dual-control requirements for wires above $2M-$5M thresholds, requiring two authorized signatories. Wire templates created during initial investments enable one-click execution for follow-ons, reducing wire time from 30 minutes to 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Verification procedures for new recipients: written GP confirmation of banking details, secondary channel verification before first-time wires. Expedited procedures for urgent situations include phone confirmation with company CFOs.</p>

<h2>Signature Authority Framework</h2>

<p>Typical tiered structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual GP authority: investments up to $1M</li>
<li>Two GPs required: $1M-$5M</li>
<li>Full investment committee: exceeding $5M</li>
</ul>

<p>Funds register 4-6 authorized signatories (all GPs plus senior principals or CFO) to ensure availability during travel, vacation, or illness. Online banking platforms enforce rules automatically: single signatory below $2M, two signatories for $2M-$5M, three signatories including senior GP above $5M.</p>

<p>Geographically dispersed teams use online platforms or mobile authentication for approvals. Update signature cards annually and whenever partnership changes occur to avoid bottlenecks from departed partners.</p>

<h2>Capital Call Cycles</h2>

<p>Typical deployment: 15-30 initial investments over 2-3 years, each followed by 2-5 follow-ons. A $200M seed fund might make 25 initial investments at $2M-$4M, then 50-100 follow-ons at $500K-$3M as companies raise subsequent rounds. Emerging managers can use the <a href="/tools/fund-launch-guide">Fund Launch Guide</a> to plan their capital call strategy from inception.</p>

<p>Most funds call capital quarterly during active deployment, moving to monthly during peak activity or semi-annually as deployment slows. A typical quarterly call:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subscription line repayment: $15M-$25M</li>
<li>Near-term investment reserves: $5M-$10M</li>
<li>Operating expenses: $2M-$3M</li>
<li>Total: 15-25% of commitments</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice periods: 10-15 business days. Call notices specify total amount, due date, wire instructions, and each LP's proportionate share. Some funds flag upcoming calls in quarterly letters to help LP liquidity planning.</p>

<p>Default remedies include 10-15% annual default interest, suspended distribution rights, and potential forfeiture. Most defaults result from administrative errors and resolve quickly; actual defaults from family office liquidity constraints require formal resolution processes.</p>

<h2>Cash Management</h2>

<p>Target cash during active deployment: 15-25% of commitments. A $300M fund might hold $45M-$75M, sufficient for 15-25 seed investments. Later in fund life, targets decline to 5-10% for follow-ons and expenses. The <a href="/tools/management-fee-calculator">Management Fee Calculator</a> helps project fee income against operational cash needs.</p>

<p>Alternative approach: maintain $10M cash plus $40M subscription line availability, providing $50M liquidity without calling capital early.</p>

<p>LPA restrictions typically limit cash investment to bank deposits, money market funds, Treasuries, and investment-grade commercial paper. Large funds use automated overnight sweeps into money market funds.</p>

<p>Opportunity cost example: holding 20% cash for two years earning 4% while deployed capital compounds at 20% creates meaningful return drag. This incentivizes minimizing balances through subscription lines and efficient call cycles.</p>

<h2>Treasury Technology</h2>

<p>Most VC funds use standard online banking platforms (wire templates, configurable approval workflows, real-time balance visibility) supplemented by Excel for forecasting. Larger platforms implement specialized treasury management systems with automated reconciliation, integrated capital call processing, cash flow forecasting, and multi-bank consolidated views. <a href="https://www.sec.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SEC</a>-registered advisers must maintain records of all wire transfers and banking activity per custody rule requirements.</p>

<p>API connections push transaction data automatically, providing real-time cash visibility and eliminating reconciliation delays. Advanced implementations enable automated wire initiation directly from fund systems.</p>

<p>Security requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-factor authentication for all banking access</li>
<li>IP address restrictions to known networks</li>
<li>Regular access reviews</li>
<li>Immediate revocation when employees leave or change roles</li>
<li>No shared credentials; regular password updates</li>
</ul>
