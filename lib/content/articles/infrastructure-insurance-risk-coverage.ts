  content: `<p>Infrastructure insurance programs must address unique exposures from capital-intensive assets, public service operations, catastrophic loss potential, extended operational periods spanning decades, and stakeholder requirements from lenders, regulators, and government partners. Coverage includes property damage from natural disasters or accidents, business interruption protecting cash flows, general and professional liability, environmental liability, and specialized coverages for sector-specific risks including utility operations, transportation accidents, or construction activities.</p>

<h2>Property and Business Interruption Coverage</h2>

<p>Infrastructure property insurance covers physical asset damage with limits matching replacement values often exceeding hundreds of millions. All-risk policies cover fire, wind, flood, earthquake (with separate endorsements), and equipment breakdown. Business interruption coverage protects cash flow during restoration following insured losses, covering lost revenues and continuing expenses over indemnity periods matching reconstruction timelines potentially spanning years for major facilities. The CFO ensures adequate limits covering full replacement costs and business interruption losses, manages premium costs through deductible optimization, and coordinates coverage across portfolio assets through master policies.</p>

<h2>Liability Coverage</h2>

<p>General liability protects against third-party injuries and property damage from operations. Infrastructure serving millions requires substantial limits ($25-100+ million) given catastrophic potential from major accidents. Professional liability covers errors in service delivery or engineering. Environmental liability addresses pollution incidents and remediation costs. The CFO structures comprehensive liability programs through primary and excess/umbrella layers, ensures contractual insurance requirements are met, and manages claims when incidents occur.</p>

<h2>Sector-Specific Coverages</h2>

<p>Transportation assets require specialized coverage for aviation liability, maritime protection, or railroad operations. Utilities need equipment breakdown and regulatory fines coverage. Construction projects during development require builders risk and construction liability. The CFO coordinates with insurance brokers specializing in infrastructure ensuring appropriate sector coverages are obtained matching asset-specific exposures.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>High-value assets require substantial coverage:</strong> Infrastructure property values and business interruption exposures demand comprehensive coverage with limits potentially exceeding hundreds of millions.</li>

<li><strong>Public service creates liability exposure:</strong> Operations serving millions require extensive liability limits protecting against catastrophic incidents.</li>

<li><strong>Sector-specific coverage is essential:</strong> Transportation, utility, and construction operations need specialized insurance addressing unique operational risks beyond general coverage.</li>

<li><strong>Lender requirements drive minimum coverage:</strong> Project finance lenders mandate property, business interruption, and liability coverage with specified limits and terms affecting insurance program design.</li>
