  content: `<p>GP-stakes compliance centers on managing conflicts inherent in affiliate relationships where the fund has access to confidential competitive information, potential influence over business decisions through board representation, and opportunities for self-dealing through co-investments, service provider selection, or allocation of investment opportunities across affiliated vehicles.</p>

<p>The compliance program must balance enabling collaborative partnerships—where the GP-stakes fund provides strategic value and operational support—while maintaining appropriate separation to prevent conflicts, protect confidential information, and avoid regulatory violations. Information barriers must be robust enough to prevent misuse of confidential portfolio GP data, yet flexible enough to allow the investment team to fulfill oversight responsibilities including board participation and portfolio monitoring.</p>

<h2>Understanding GP-Stakes Compliance Framework</h2>

<h3>Affiliate Relationships and Conflicts</h3>

<p>When a GP-stakes fund acquires equity in an alternative asset management company, it becomes an affiliate for regulatory and conflict-of-interest purposes. "Control" typically means ownership of 25%+ of voting securities, though functional control through board representation, veto rights, or operational influence can create affiliate status at lower ownership percentages.</p>

<p>Affiliate status triggers compliance obligations: affiliated transactions require special treatment to ensure fairness and prevent self-dealing; access to confidential information about the portfolio GP's business, strategy, fundraising, and holdings creates misuse potential; influence over portfolio GP decisions through board seats creates opportunities to favor the GP-stakes fund's interests over other stakeholders; and regulatory filings may require disclosure of affiliate relationships.</p>

<h3>Core Compliance Program Elements</h3>

<p>The CCO designs a program with these core elements: policies documenting how affiliate transactions are identified, evaluated, and approved; information barriers ("ethical walls") segregating confidential information on a need-to-know basis; conflicts disclosure in Form ADV Part 2A; valuation governance ensuring portfolio GP valuations are determined independently; regulatory coordination with portfolio GP compliance functions; personal trading oversight preventing front-running or misuse of confidential information; and compliance monitoring and testing.</p>

<h3>Risk-Based Approach</h3>

<p>The CCO calibrates control intensity to specific risk factors: ownership percentage, board representation (management committee seats create greater influence than passive minority positions), access to confidential information (extensive portfolio company data vs. high-level summaries), economic structure (revenue participation vs. common equity), and relationships with portfolio GP's underlying funds. Higher-risk relationships warrant formal committee approvals, documented independent reviews, and enhanced monitoring.</p>

<h2>Affiliate Transaction Management and Controls</h2>

<h3>Co-Investment Opportunities with Portfolio GP Funds</h3>

<p>Example: A GP-stakes fund owns 30% of a private equity firm making a $200M investment. The PE fund can bring in co-investors, and the GP-stakes fund's manager also runs a separate direct PE fund that could participate. The GP-stakes fund manager has competing interests: maximizing returns for its direct PE fund, maintaining portfolio GP relationships, and fulfilling fiduciary duties to GP-stakes fund investors.</p>

<p>Policies governing co-investments include: conflicts committee or independent review evaluating appropriateness and pricing; documentation of the opportunity, pricing terms, allocation methodology, and rationale; disclosure ensuring all fund investors understand affiliate relationships; and fairness opinions from third-party valuation firms for significant transactions.</p>

<p>Allocation across multiple accounts follows documented policies based on strategy fit, available capital, existing exposure (diversification), and pro-rata allocation when multiple appropriate funds exist. Allocation must not favor funds generating higher adviser fees.</p>

<h3>Service Provider Relationships</h3>

<p>GP-stakes funds often have relationships with service providers—administrators, auditors, legal counsel, consultants—who also serve portfolio GPs or their funds. In some cases, the GP-stakes fund may receive fees or other consideration for referring service providers to portfolio GPs, creating potential conflicts. The CCO implements controls including disclosure of relationships ensuring portfolio GPs understand when recommended service providers have existing relationships with the GP-stakes fund, fee transparency where any referral fees, revenue sharing, or other consideration received by the GP-stakes fund from service providers is disclosed and, where appropriate, passed through to the benefiting fund rather than retained by the adviser, independent evaluation requiring portfolio GPs to independently evaluate service providers rather than being pressured to use providers affiliated with the GP-stakes fund, and documentation maintaining records of service provider recommendation rationale, any compensation received, and approval processes.</p>

<p>Self-dealing situations require particular scrutiny. If the GP-stakes fund manager owns or has an economic interest in a service provider (for example, a technology platform used by fund managers, or a placement agent), and that service provider is engaged by portfolio GPs, the conflict must be disclosed and carefully managed. Best practice typically involves conflicts committee approval where independent parties evaluate whether engagement is appropriate, arms-length pricing ensuring fees charged to portfolio GPs are market-rate and not inflated to benefit the affiliated service provider, alternative evaluation requiring portfolio GPs to evaluate alternative service providers and document why the affiliated provider is selected, and investor disclosure explaining the relationship and conflict management approach in offering documents and periodic communications.</p>

<h3>Strategic Decision Influence and Conflicts</h3>

<p>When GP-stakes funds have board representation or significant governance rights with portfolio GPs, decisions made in those capacities can create conflicts. For example, the portfolio GP is considering launching a new fund strategy that might compete with a fund strategy run by the GP-stakes fund manager. Or the portfolio GP is considering a significant expense investment (hiring senior talent, opening a new office, expanding into new geography) that might reduce near-term profitability and management fee distributions but could enhance long-term value.</p>

<p>The GP-stakes fund representative must balance the duty to act in the portfolio GP's best interests against the natural bias toward outcomes favoring the GP-stakes fund's own returns. The CCO provides guidance to investment team members serving in governance roles emphasizing fiduciary duties to the portfolio GP and its LPs that supersede the GP-stakes fund's direct economic interests, recusal procedures where the GP-stakes fund representative recuses from voting on decisions where conflicts are particularly acute, documentation requiring written analysis when significant decisions are made explaining the rationale and how conflicts were considered, and periodic training reminding investment team members of their duties and conflict management obligations when serving in governance capacities.</p>

<h2>Information Barriers and Confidential Information Protection</h2>

<p>GP-stakes investors receive highly sensitive competitive and business information from portfolio GPs that must be strictly protected to prevent misuse and maintain portfolio GP trust and confidentiality.</p>

<h3>Types of Confidential Information</h3>

<p>Portfolio GPs share substantial confidential information with GP-stakes investors including fundraising activities and pipeline (which investors are committing, expected close dates, terms), fund performance and portfolio company details (underlying holdings, valuations, exits in process), strategic plans (geographic expansion, new strategies, team hiring plans, succession planning), financial information (management company revenue, expenses, EBITDA margins), LP relationships and feedback (which LPs are satisfied, which are concerned, re-up likelihood), and competitive intelligence (perceptions of competing managers, market trends, deal flow). This information would be highly valuable to competitors, other portfolio GPs in the GP-stakes fund's portfolio, or for the GP-stakes fund's own investment decision-making if used improperly.</p>

<h3>Information Barrier Construction</h3>

<p>The CCO implements information barriers restricting access to confidential portfolio GP information through several mechanisms. Physical separation includes dedicated office space or restricted areas where confidential information is discussed or stored, with access limited to personnel with legitimate need, locked file cabinets or secure rooms for physical documents, and separate meeting spaces for discussions involving confidential information from different portfolio GPs. Electronic controls include restricted network folders or drives accessible only to authorized users, encryption of sensitive documents and emails containing confidential information, access logs tracking who accesses confidential information and when, and data loss prevention tools preventing confidential information from being forwarded outside authorized groups or downloaded to unauthorized devices.</p>

<p>Personnel designations identify "public side" versus "private side" personnel where public side personnel work on investment sourcing, initial due diligence, and activities not requiring access to highly confidential portfolio GP information, while private side personnel work directly with portfolio GPs and have access to detailed confidential information but are restricted from certain activities like investing in the same strategies. For example, an investment professional monitoring a portfolio GP private equity fund might be restricted from leading sourcing or due diligence on new private equity GP-stakes investments to prevent inadvertent use of confidential information.</p>

<h3>Need-to-Know Principle</h3>

<p>Access to confidential portfolio GP information follows a strict need-to-know principle where only personnel with legitimate business reasons to access specific information are granted access. The investment team member serving on a portfolio GP's board needs access to that portfolio GP's confidential information, but doesn't need access to confidential information from other portfolio GPs. Back-office personnel like compliance, finance, or administrative staff typically don't need access to detailed competitive information—they can perform their functions with high-level data.</p>

<p>The CCO maintains documentation of information barrier designations showing which personnel are on public versus private side for different portfolio GPs, rationale for access grants when personnel need access to confidential information, training records confirming all personnel understand information barrier policies, and periodic reviews of access logs identifying any unusual access patterns warranting investigation. Annual recertification processes require supervisors to affirm that their team members' information access remains appropriate given current responsibilities.</p>

<h3>Monitoring and Testing</h3>

<p>Information barriers are only effective if adhered to in practice. The CCO implements monitoring including email surveillance reviewing samples of emails for potential information barrier breaches (e.g., confidential portfolio GP information being shared with unauthorized personnel), access log reviews checking for personnel accessing information outside their designated areas, exception reports flagging unusual patterns like access to confidential information shortly before making investment decisions that might benefit from that information, and employee interviews and certifications periodically confirming understanding and compliance with policies. When breaches are identified, the CCO investigates to determine whether inadvertent (requiring additional training) or intentional (potentially warranting discipline), implements remediation addressing the specific failure and preventing recurrence, and considers whether disclosure is required to affected parties.</p>

<h2>Valuation Governance and Conflicts Management</h2>

<p>Valuing portfolio GP stakes creates conflicts because higher valuations benefit the GP-stakes fund's performance and potentially the GP's carried interest, but must accurately reflect fair value to comply with GAAP and protect fund investors.</p>

<h3>Valuation Process Separation</h3>

<p>The GP-stakes fund implements segregation of duties in valuation processes where investment team members who manage portfolio GP relationships and benefit from higher valuations don't solely determine valuations—independent valuation specialists or committees provide review and approval, written valuation memos prepared by the investment team are reviewed and challenged by independent parties before finalization, and conflicts analysis identifies scenarios where the investment team might have particular bias (e.g., if an upcoming fundraise for a new fund depends on strong current fund performance, there might be pressure to mark up valuations). The CCO ensures this separation is maintained and documented.</p>

<h3>Independent Valuation Specialists</h3>

<p>Many GP-stakes funds engage third-party valuation firms to perform or review portfolio GP valuations quarterly or annually, providing independent perspective. These specialists review DCF models and assumptions prepared by the fund GP or investment team, challenge assumptions that appear aggressive relative to market data or portfolio GP performance, provide market comparables based on recent GP-stakes transactions or public market asset manager valuations, and issue opinions or reports that the administrator and auditors can rely on during financial reporting and audit processes. While the fund GP retains ultimate valuation authority and responsibility, independent specialist involvement reduces conflict concerns and enhances credibility with investors and auditors.</p>

<h3>Valuation Committee Governance</h3>

<p>Larger GP-stakes funds often establish valuation committees that meet quarterly to review and approve portfolio valuations. Committee membership typically includes senior investment professionals not directly managing the specific position being valued, CFO or other finance personnel responsible for accurate financial reporting, CCO to provide compliance perspective on conflicts and fair dealing, and sometimes independent outside members such as fund advisory board representatives or unaffiliated industry experts. The committee reviews valuation proposals, challenges assumptions, considers whether valuations are consistent with portfolio GP performance and market conditions, and formally approves valuations for financial reporting. Documented minutes provide audit trail of the deliberation and approval process.</p>

<h3>Disclosure of Valuation Conflicts</h3>

<p>Form ADV Part 2A requires disclosure of valuation conflicts and processes. The GP-stakes fund's ADV should explain that the fund values portfolio GP equity stakes using DCF and other methodologies requiring judgment, valuations are inherently subjective and actual exit proceeds may differ substantially from carrying values, the GP benefits from higher valuations through carried interest and performance fee calculations, and the fund mitigates valuation conflicts through independent review, valuation committee approval, third-party valuation specialist engagement, or other specific controls. This disclosure ensures investors understand the potential conflicts and how they're managed.</p>

<h2>Form ADV and Form PF Reporting for GP-Stakes Funds</h2>

<p>Registered investment advisers managing GP-stakes funds file Form ADV and Form PF addressing GP-stakes-specific disclosure and reporting requirements.</p>

<h3>Form ADV Part 2A Brochure Disclosures</h3>

<p>The Form ADV Part 2A brochure provides narrative disclosure about advisory services, fees, conflicts, and other matters. GP-stakes fund advisers include several key GP-stakes-specific disclosures. Investment strategy descriptions explain that the fund invests in equity stakes in alternative asset management companies rather than directly in portfolio companies, helping investors understand the unique risk-return profile. Conflicts of interest sections address affiliate transaction conflicts including co-investment opportunities with portfolio GP funds and allocation across affiliated accounts, information barrier policies protecting confidential portfolio GP information, and valuation conflicts and governance processes. Fee disclosures explain how management fees and carried interest are calculated on GP-stakes investments, which may differ from traditional private equity fee structures.</p>

<p>Disciplinary disclosures must include any regulatory actions, litigation, or other disciplinary matters involving the adviser or its personnel, with particular attention to matters involving conflicts of interest or fiduciary duty breaches relevant to the GP-stakes strategy. The CCO conducts periodic background checks and disciplinary reviews to ensure Form ADV remains current.</p>

<h3>Form PF Reporting for GP-Stakes Strategies</h3>

<p>Large private equity fund advisers (those managing $2B+ in private equity fund assets) file Form PF including Section 4 covering private equity fund operations. GP-stakes fund advisers complete Form PF reporting addressing how GP-stakes investments are classified—typically as a distinct private equity strategy rather than a traditional buyout or growth equity strategy, portfolio concentration showing how assets are allocated across portfolio GPs and geographic regions, and leverage information including any fund-level borrowing or underlying leverage at portfolio GPs. Accurate Form PF reporting requires detailed data aggregation from portfolio GP operations and thoughtful analysis of how to categorize investments for regulatory reporting purposes.</p>

<h3>Ongoing ADV Amendments and Updates</h3>

<p>The CCO ensures Form ADV remains current through annual amendments filed within 90 days of fiscal year-end reviewing all disclosures for accuracy and identifying items requiring updating, more frequent amendments when material changes occur such as new conflicts identified, changes to valuation processes, significant disciplinary matters, or material changes to the firm's business or personnel, and documentation maintaining detailed records of what changes were made and when, supporting the adviser's compliance with ongoing ADV update obligations.</p>

<h2>Co-Investment Allocation Across Multiple Funds</h2>

<p>When a GP-stakes fund adviser manages multiple funds or accounts—for example, a GP-stakes fund, a direct private equity fund, and separate accounts—allocating co-investment opportunities across these vehicles requires fair and transparent processes.</p>

<h3>Allocation Policy Framework</h3>

<p>The adviser adopts a written allocation policy documenting the methodology for allocating investment opportunities across funds and accounts. Key policy elements include strategy fit criteria defining which funds are appropriate recipients for different opportunity types based on investment mandates, available capital considerations factoring in which funds have capacity to make investments based on commitments, current investment pace, and remaining deployment period, concentration limits ensuring no single fund becomes overconcentrated in a sector, geography, or issuer, pro-rata allocation as a baseline approach when multiple appropriate funds have capacity, with exceptions documented and justified, and rotational or other alternative approaches if appropriate for the specific adviser's fund structures and investor expectations.</p>

<p>For GP-stakes-specific co-investment allocation, the policy addresses how co-investment opportunities sourced through portfolio GP relationships are allocated. If the adviser manages both a GP-stakes fund and a direct PE fund, does the GP-stakes fund get priority access to portfolio GP co-invest opportunities as part of the value exchange in the GP-stakes relationship? Or are opportunities allocated pro-rata across all appropriate funds? The policy should be clear, disclosed to all fund investors upfront, and consistently followed.</p>

<h3>Allocation Documentation and Compliance Review</h3>

<p>For each investment opportunity, the investment team documents the allocation decision including list of funds considered for allocation, rationale for why certain funds received allocation and others didn't, evidence that the allocation policy was followed, and approval by appropriate personnel (typically the CIO or an allocation committee). The CCO periodically reviews allocation decisions as part of compliance monitoring, looking for patterns suggesting deviation from policy, favoritism toward certain funds (particularly funds generating higher fees for the adviser), or allocations inconsistent with stated rationale. Findings are reported to senior management or the board with recommendations for policy or practice improvements.</p>

<h3>Fairness and Conflicts</h3>

<p>Even with clear policies, allocation across affiliated funds creates conflicts requiring ongoing vigilance. The adviser should not favor one fund over another based on which generates higher fees, which is performing better and needs favorable opportunities to boost performance, or which has investors the adviser wishes to favor. All funds and investors must be treated fairly based on objective criteria consistently applied. The CCO provides oversight ensuring this standard is met, escalating concerns when allocation decisions appear inconsistent with policy or fairness principles.</p>

<h2>Regulatory Coordination with Portfolio GPs</h2>

<p>GP-stakes funds and their portfolio GPs often both are SEC-registered investment advisers subject to examination, compliance obligations, and various regulatory requirements that benefit from coordination.</p>

<h3>SEC Examination Coordination</h3>

<p>When the SEC examines the GP-stakes fund's investment adviser, examiners may have questions about portfolio GP relationships, information barriers, valuation processes, and affiliate transactions. Similarly, when the SEC examines a portfolio GP, examiners might inquire about relationships with GP-stakes investors and any influence those investors exert over fund management or decision-making. The CCO coordinates with portfolio GP compliance officers to ensure consistent messaging, share relevant information where appropriate without compromising confidentiality, prepare for potential examiner questions about the relationship, and respond efficiently to requests for information or documents.</p>

<p>This coordination is facilitated by establishing regular communication channels between CCOs including periodic calls or meetings to discuss regulatory developments, sharing examination experience and lessons learned (in general terms without disclosing confidential examination details), and developing mutual understanding of each party's compliance programs and controls. When either party receives an examination or information request related to the relationship, promptly notifying the other party enables coordinated and consistent responses.</p>

<h3>Beneficial Ownership and Control Reporting</h3>

<p>If the GP-stakes fund acquires significant ownership (typically 25%+) in a portfolio GP registered with the SEC, beneficial ownership reporting may be required on Schedule 13D or 13G (if the portfolio GP has a class of equity securities registered under the Exchange Act) or similar state-level filings. The CCO monitors ownership levels and understands reporting triggers, coordinates with legal counsel on filings when required, and ensures timely and accurate reporting of beneficial ownership and control relationships.</p>

<h3>Information Sharing Protocols</h3>

<p>The GP-stakes fund and portfolio GP establish protocols governing what information can be shared and under what circumstances. For example, during SEC examinations, the portfolio GP might want to understand what the GP-stakes fund disclosed about their relationship, or vice versa. The parties agree in advance on confidentiality obligations protecting each party's confidential information, circumstances where information sharing is appropriate (e.g., coordinating on regulatory matters, addressing audit or tax questions), and escalation procedures when questions arise about whether sharing specific information is appropriate. These protocols are documented and followed consistently to protect both parties.</p>

<h2>Personal Trading and Front-Running Prevention</h2>

<p>Investment team members with access to confidential portfolio GP information could potentially use that information for personal trading or other inappropriate purposes requiring controls.</p>

<h3>Personal Trading Policies</h3>

<p>The GP-stakes fund adopts personal trading policies restricting access persons (typically investment professionals and other personnel with access to investment-related information) from engaging in transactions creating conflicts including investments in publicly traded asset managers that might compete with or be comparable to portfolio GPs (creating conflicts if the access person has confidential information affecting valuation or competitive positioning), investments in securities issued by portfolio companies held by portfolio GP funds (creating insider trading risk if the access person has material nonpublic information about those companies through the portfolio GP relationship), and short sales or derivatives creating incentive for the access person to act contrary to fund and portfolio GP interests. Access persons typically must pre-clear personal securities transactions with the CCO or designee before executing, ensuring the transaction doesn't raise conflict or insider trading concerns.</p>

<h3>Monitoring and Reporting</h3>

<p>Access persons submit quarterly transaction reports listing all securities transactions in their personal accounts, and annual holdings reports listing all securities held. The CCO or designee reviews these reports comparing personal trading activity against watch lists of restricted securities, flagging transactions that occurred in proximity to portfolio GP information being received or used by the fund, and looking for patterns suggesting misuse of information or other policy violations. Technology platforms used by many advisers automate much of this monitoring, generating exception reports for CCO review.</p>

<h3>Insider Trading Risks</h3>

<p>GP-stakes fund personnel may come into possession of material nonpublic information (MNPI) about publicly traded companies through portfolio GP relationships. For example, a portfolio GP is considering an acquisition of a public company, and the GP-stakes fund representative serving on the portfolio GP's board learns about the potential transaction before public announcement. This creates insider trading risk if the GP-stakes fund, its personnel, or fund investors trade in the target company's securities based on the MNPI.</p>

<p>The CCO implements insider trading controls including training ensuring all personnel understand insider trading laws, their obligations when they possess MNPI, and consequences of violations, restricted lists maintained when the firm possesses MNPI about specific issuers, prohibiting trading in those securities, watch lists for monitoring purposes tracking issuers where MNPI might be received even if trading isn't currently prohibited, and escalation procedures requiring immediate reporting to the CCO when personnel believe they may have received MNPI so appropriate restrictions can be implemented. These controls protect both the firm and its personnel from insider trading liability.</p>

<h2>Investor Communications and Disclosures</h2>

<p>Transparent communication with GP-stakes fund investors about affiliate relationships, conflicts, and how they're managed builds trust and satisfies regulatory obligations.</p>

<h3>Offering Document Disclosures</h3>

<p>The GP-stakes fund's private placement memorandum (PPM) or limited partnership agreement (LPA) includes comprehensive disclosure of affiliate relationships and conflicts including general description of affiliate transaction types (co-investments, service provider relationships, strategic decisions) and associated conflicts, information barrier policies and how confidential information is protected, valuation governance including independent review processes and conflicts management, allocation policies for co-investment opportunities across multiple funds, and regulatory status and coordination obligations. These disclosures should be specific and meaningful—not boilerplate—enabling investors to understand the actual conflicts they face and how the adviser manages them.</p>

<h3>Periodic Reporting</h3>

<p>Quarterly or annual reports to investors should provide transparency about affiliate transactions and conflicts management implementation including list of co-investments or other affiliate transactions completed during the period with summary of terms, approvals obtained, and fairness analysis, information barrier effectiveness reporting any breaches or incidents and remediation steps, valuation governance explaining any significant valuation changes or methodologies, and regulatory developments including examination results, enforcement actions, or other matters affecting the adviser or portfolio GPs. This ongoing transparency reinforces that the adviser takes conflicts seriously and operates with integrity.</p>

<h3>Material Changes and Updates</h3>

<p>When material changes occur—such as new types of affiliate transactions arising, changes to information barrier policies, or new conflicts identified—the adviser promptly communicates with investors rather than waiting for the next periodic report. Prompt disclosure demonstrates commitment to transparency and allows investors to understand developments as they occur rather than learning about them in hindsight.</p>

<h2>Compliance Monitoring and Testing</h2>

<p>The CCO implements ongoing monitoring and periodic testing of compliance controls to ensure they remain effective.</p>

<h3>Monitoring Activities</h3>

<p>Continuous or frequent monitoring activities include transaction review examining investment transactions and affiliate dealings for compliance with policies, exception reports generated by compliance systems flagging unusual activities or potential policy violations, trade surveillance for personal trading violations or front-running concerns, and access log reviews checking that information barriers are respected and confidential information access is limited to authorized personnel. These monitoring activities are documented showing what was reviewed, findings identified, and follow-up actions taken.</p>

<h3>Annual Testing</h3>

<p>At least annually, the CCO conducts comprehensive testing of compliance program elements including policies and procedures review ensuring policies remain current and appropriate for the firm's operations, sample testing of key controls selecting samples of transactions, allocation decisions, or other activities and verifying controls functioned as designed, interviews with investment team members and other personnel assessing understanding of policies and identifying potential issues, and gap analysis comparing the firm's program against regulatory requirements, industry best practices, and peer firm approaches. Test findings are documented in an annual compliance report presented to senior management or the board with recommendations for program enhancements.</p>

<h3>Continuous Improvement</h3>

<p>Compliance programs should continuously improve based on monitoring findings, test results, regulatory developments, and industry evolution. The CCO implements a continuous improvement process tracking issues identified through monitoring and testing, implementing corrective actions and enhancements, monitoring effectiveness of corrective actions, and updating policies and training based on lessons learned. This iterative approach ensures the program adapts to changing business activities, regulatory expectations, and emerging risks.</p>

<h2>Advisory Board and LP Advisory Committee Considerations</h2>

<p>Many GP-stakes funds establish advisory boards or LP advisory committees (LPACs) providing governance oversight and addressing conflicts, often with particular focus on GP-stakes-specific issues.</p>

<h3>Advisory Board Composition and Role</h3>

<p>Advisory boards typically include representatives from significant LP investors in the GP-stakes fund, independent outside members with relevant expertise (e.g., former asset managers, regulatory professionals), and sometimes the fund GP's senior leadership (though usually not voting members to avoid conflicts). The board's role includes reviewing and approving significant affiliate transactions or conflicts where independent LP perspective provides comfort that deals are fair, providing input on strategic matters like fund-level decisions or major portfolio GP developments, serving as a resource for management on industry trends and best practices, and escalation point for compliance or ethical concerns that investors or personnel want to raise outside normal channels.</p>

<p>The CCO coordinates with the advisory board by providing periodic compliance updates reporting on program effectiveness, any significant issues, and regulatory developments, requesting review and approval for significant conflict transactions when appropriate, and facilitating board access to information and personnel needed for the board to fulfill its oversight role. Well-functioning advisory boards enhance governance and provide independent oversight that protects investors and strengthens the firm's reputation.</p>

<h3>LPAC Considerations for GP-Stakes Structures</h3>

<p>GP-stakes fund LPACs may address matters specific to this strategy including approval of co-investments or other affiliate transactions above certain size thresholds, review of valuation methodologies and significant valuation changes given the subjectivity of management company valuations, consent to potential conflicts such as launching new funds that might compete with portfolio GPs, and input on strategic matters like whether to pursue certain investment opportunities or exit strategies. The LPAC provides independent LP input and approval on matters where the GP has conflicts, strengthening governance and aligning interests across stakeholders.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Affiliate relationships create pervasive conflicts requiring systematic management:</strong> Co-investment opportunities, service provider relationships, board participation, and access to confidential information generate conflicts that must be identified, disclosed, and managed through independent review, documented policies, and ongoing monitoring.</li>

<li><strong>Information barriers must balance access and protection:</strong> Investment team members need access to portfolio GP business information to fulfill oversight and value-add responsibilities, yet confidential information must be strictly protected through physical separation, electronic controls, need-to-know restrictions, and compliance monitoring to prevent misuse.</li>

<li><strong>Valuation governance prevents conflicts in fair value determinations:</strong> Segregating valuation responsibilities from investment team members benefiting from higher valuations, engaging independent valuation specialists, and implementing valuation committee oversight ensures valuations are determined fairly and accurately despite inherent conflicts.</li>

<li><strong>Form ADV must comprehensively disclose GP-stakes conflicts:</strong> Affiliate transaction conflicts, information barrier policies, valuation processes, allocation methodologies, and regulatory coordination must be clearly explained in Form ADV Part 2A enabling investors to understand risks and how conflicts are managed.</li>

<li><strong>Co-investment allocation across multiple funds requires written policies and documentation:</strong> When advisers manage both GP-stakes funds and other vehicles eligible for portfolio GP co-investments, clear allocation policies based on objective criteria—strategy fit, available capital, concentration—must be established, disclosed, and consistently followed with documented rationale for each decision.</li>

<li><strong>Regulatory coordination with portfolio GPs enhances examination preparedness:</strong> Establishing communication channels with portfolio GP compliance officers, coordinating responses when either party faces SEC examination, and agreeing on information sharing protocols facilitates efficient regulatory compliance and consistent messaging.</li>

<li><strong>Personal trading policies prevent front-running and insider trading:</strong> Investment professionals with access to confidential portfolio GP information must be restricted from personal trading in comparable asset managers or portfolio company securities, with pre-clearance, quarterly reporting, and monitoring preventing misuse of information.</li>

<li><strong>Insider trading risks arise from board participation and confidential information access:</strong> GP-stakes fund representatives serving on portfolio GP boards may receive material nonpublic information about portfolio companies before public disclosure, requiring restricted lists, escalation procedures, and training to prevent unlawful trading.</li>

<li><strong>Advisory boards and LPACs provide independent conflict review and governance:</strong> Establishing advisory boards with LP representatives and independent members to review significant affiliate transactions, approve conflict matters, and provide strategic input strengthens governance and demonstrates commitment to fair dealing.</li>

<li><strong>Continuous monitoring and annual testing ensure program effectiveness:</strong> Transaction reviews, exception reports, information barrier audits, and annual comprehensive testing of controls identify gaps, validate effectiveness, and enable continuous improvement adapting to evolving business activities and regulatory expectations.</li>
