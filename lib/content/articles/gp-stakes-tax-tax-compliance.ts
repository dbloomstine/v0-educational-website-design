  content: `<p>GP-stakes tax planning addresses income character from management fees taxed as ordinary income versus carried interest eligible for capital gains treatment, timing differences between economic distributions and tax income recognition, partnership structure optimization minimizing tax leakage at fund and investor levels, and state tax considerations when portfolio GPs operate across multiple jurisdictions. Tax advisors coordinate with portfolio GP tax teams ensuring proper reporting and optimizing structure efficiency.</p>

<h2>Income Character and Classification</h2>

<p>GP-stakes generate income from multiple sources with different tax treatment. Management fee distributions constitute ordinary income taxed at higher rates, carried interest typically qualifies for long-term capital gains treatment subject to holding period requirements, and appreciation from stake sales produces capital gains. The tax team ensures proper characterization on K-1s distinguishing ordinary income from capital gains, tracks holding periods determining long-term versus short-term treatment, and considers Section 1061 three-year holding requirements for carried interest capital gains treatment. Proper classification is critical as management fee income faces significantly higher tax rates than capital gains from carry or stake appreciation.</p>

<h2>Partnership Structure Optimization</h2>

<p>GP-stakes structures impact tax efficiency. Direct ownership of management company equity provides simplest structure with flow-through taxation. Alternative structures include blocker corporations when investors prefer entity-level taxation, single-purpose vehicles for individual GP stakes enabling targeted exposure, and tiered partnerships accommodating different investor classes. Structure decisions consider tax efficiency balancing flow-through benefits against administrative complexity, investor base preferences for K-1s versus other reporting, international investor needs potentially requiring FIRPTA withholding or treaty planning, and state tax implications from multi-jurisdictional management company operations.</p>

<h2>Coordination with Portfolio GP Tax Teams</h2>

<p>Tax planning requires collaboration with portfolio GP tax advisors. Coordination includes Schedule K-1 timing and accuracy ensuring GP-stakes fund receives information for investor reporting, basis tracking for management company interests determining gain or loss on disposition, carried interest reporting obtaining details on character and sourcing, and withholding compliance for state taxes or international obligations. Regular communication with portfolio GP tax teams ensures accurate reporting and identifies planning opportunities. The tax director maintains relationships with multiple portfolio GP tax advisors managing coordination complexity.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Income sources have different tax character:</strong> Management fees generate ordinary income while carried interest and stake appreciation typically qualify for capital gains treatment.</li>

<li><strong>Section 1061 affects carry treatment:</strong> Three-year holding requirements for capital gains treatment on carried interest require careful tracking and planning.</li>

<li><strong>Structure impacts tax efficiency:</strong> Direct ownership, blockers, or tiered partnerships create different tax profiles affecting investor returns.</li>

<li><strong>Multi-jurisdictional complexity is common:</strong> Portfolio GPs operating across states create varying tax obligations requiring comprehensive compliance management.</li>
