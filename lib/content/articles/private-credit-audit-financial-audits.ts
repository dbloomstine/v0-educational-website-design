  content: `<p>Financial statement audits provide independent verification of fund NAV, validate credit loss allowances under CECL methodology, and confirm loan portfolio valuations for illiquid debt instruments. Unlike private equity fund audits focused on equity valuations, private credit audits require expertise in loan accounting, credit risk assessment, interest income recognition, and specialized structures including BDCs and RICs. The <a href="https://www.aicpa.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AICPA</a> sets professional standards that govern audit procedures for investment funds.</p>

<p>LPAs typically mandate annual audits by PCAOB-registered accounting firms, with most funds targeting completion within 120 days of fiscal year-end. The audit process involves extensive testing of loan portfolios, CECL allowance validation, fair value procedures for illiquid instruments, and specialized testing for BDC asset coverage ratios or RIC qualification requirements when applicable. Understanding your <a href="/tools/fund-expense-allocation">fund expense allocation</a> framework early helps streamline audit preparation.</p>

<h2>Audit Firm Selection and Engagement</h2>

<h3>Big Four vs. Specialized Firms</h3>

<p>Big Four firms dominate private credit audit market share, particularly for larger institutional funds and BDCs. They provide brand recognition valued by institutional LPs, deep CECL and fair value expertise, global capabilities for international portfolios, and valuation specialist resources. However, they typically command 30-50% premium pricing over specialized alternatives.</p>

<p>Specialized firms focusing on alternative investments offer competitive fees, significant partner attention, focused credit fund expertise, and flexible service models. Many emerging managers use specialized firms effectively when their LP base doesn't require Big Four names. Some institutional investors and BDC listing requirements mandate Big Four auditors.</p>

<h3>Evaluation Criteria</h3>

<p>Key selection factors include experience with private credit strategies and loan types, CECL and fair value expertise, fee structures, service level commitments, and LP acceptance requirements. Evaluate auditors' experience with CECL methodology, fair value measurement for illiquid instruments compliant with <a href="https://fasb.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FASB</a> standards like ASC 820, PIK interest and OID accounting, and BDC/RIC compliance testing.</p>

<h3>Annual Audit Fees</h3>

<p>Typical fee ranges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emerging managers (under $250M AUM): $25,000-$60,000</li>
<li>Established funds ($500M-$2B): $75,000-$200,000</li>
<li>Larger platforms/BDCs: $250,000+</li>
</ul>

<p>Fees increase with significant Level 3 positions requiring valuation specialists, complex CECL methodologies, BDC Investment Company Act compliance, RIC tax status testing, or credit events requiring expanded procedures.</p>

<h2>Annual Audit Process and Timeline</h2>

<h3>Audit Planning Phase</h3>

<p>Planning begins 60-90 days before fiscal year-end, addressing portfolio composition changes, accounting policy updates, CECL methodology refinements, and timeline coordination. Risk assessment evaluates industry concentration, credit quality trends, complex loan structures, and control environment changes. Materiality typically ranges from 0.5-2% of NAV.</p>

<h3>Interim Testing</h3>

<p>Fourth-quarter interim testing covers controls over loan administration and NAV calculation, CECL model governance, interest income procedures, and SOC report review. This identifies control deficiencies with time for remediation before year-end.</p>

<h3>Year-End Fieldwork</h3>

<p>Fieldwork begins mid-to-late January and spans 4-6 weeks. Auditors request year-end position reports, send confirmation requests to borrowers, review CECL calculations, test fair value documentation, and examine interest income reconciliations. Fund management supports critical areas including Level 3 valuations, CECL assumptions, credit event explanations, and oversight evidence.</p>

<p>Borrower confirmations verify principal balances, rates, terms, and collateral. When confirmations aren't received, auditors perform alternative procedures including examining subsequent payments and reviewing loan agreements.</p>

<h3>Completion and Report Issuance</h3>

<p>Auditors target completion within 90 days of year-end, enabling distribution within LPA's typical 120-day requirement. Deliverables include auditor's opinion, financial statements, and notes addressing accounting policies, loan portfolio composition, CECL methodology, fair value disclosures, and related party transactions.</p>

<h2>Loan Portfolio Testing</h2>

<p>Loan portfolio testing represents the most extensive audit component, as loans typically comprise 80-95% of total assets. Auditors test existence, completeness, rights and obligations, valuation, and presentation.</p>

<h3>Existence and Confirmation</h3>

<p>Auditors send confirmation requests to borrowers verifying principal balances, interest rates, maturity dates, and security interests. Response rates for middle-market borrowers often lag traditional corporate borrowers. When confirmations aren't received, auditors perform alternative procedures: examining subsequent cash receipts, reviewing loan agreements, verifying funding through bank statements, and obtaining position confirmations from loan agents.</p>

<h3>Completeness and Rights Testing</h3>

<p>Completeness testing traces funding transactions from bank statements to loan records. Auditors examine cash receipts from repayments and reconcile between loan administration, fund accounting, and portfolio management systems.</p>

<p>Rights testing examines executed loan agreements for principal amounts, rates, terms, and security interests. For secured loans, auditors verify perfection through UCC filings, mortgage recordings, and intercreditor agreements.</p>

<h3>Documentation Requirements</h3>

<p>Loan files should contain executed agreements with amendments, security documents and UCC filings, closing memoranda, borrower financials and covenant certificates, correspondence on waivers, collateral appraisals, and credit memoranda. Auditors employ sampling methodologies, stratifying by loan size, credit quality, vintage, and sector. Nonaccrual loans, covenant violations, and restructurings receive enhanced testing.</p>

<h2>Credit Loss Allowance Validation (CECL)</h2>

<p>CECL under ASC 326, as promulgated by <a href="https://fasb.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FASB</a>, requires recognition of expected credit losses over contractual loan lives, including day-one losses on newly originated loans. This forward-looking approach creates substantial audit challenges.</p>

<h3>CECL Methodology</h3>

<p>Common methodologies include vintage analysis (grouping loans by origination year and analyzing historical loss rates), probability of default/loss given default (estimating default likelihood and severity), and discounted cash flow (comparing amortized cost to present value of expected cash flows). Auditors evaluate whether the chosen method suits portfolio characteristics and is applied consistently.</p>

<h3>Key Testing Areas</h3>

<p><strong>Historical Loss Experience:</strong> Auditors verify loss data accuracy, validate completeness against accounting records, and assess whether historical periods selected are appropriate. Newer funds may rely on industry data when establishing loss histories.</p>

<p><strong>Economic Forecasts:</strong> The reasonable and supportable forecast period typically ranges from 12-36 months. Auditors assess whether forecasted variables (GDP, unemployment, default rates) are relevant to portfolio credit risk and whether scenarios are appropriately weighted. Reversion methodology after the forecast period must be documented and consistent.</p>

<p><strong>Qualitative Adjustments:</strong> Adjustments for factors not captured in quantitative models require documentation of factors addressed, quantification methodology, and magnitude support.</p>

<p><strong>Nonaccrual Loans:</strong> Individual loan analysis replaces pool-based methods. Auditors review borrower financial performance, collateral valuations, and cash flow projections for impaired loans.</p>

<h2>Fair Value Audit Procedures</h2>

<p>Funds electing fair value for loans face ASC 820 measurement requirements per <a href="https://fasb.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FASB</a> guidance. Most private credit holdings are Level 3 (unobservable inputs) given lack of observable market data for private loans. Use the <a href="/tools/distribution-waterfall">Distribution Waterfall Visualizer</a> to model how valuations flow through to LP/GP economics.</p>

<h3>Valuation Techniques</h3>

<p><strong>Discounted Cash Flow:</strong> The most common technique projects contractual payments, adjusts for expected prepayments or defaults, and discounts at risk-adjusted rates. Auditors test payment terms, credit adjustment assumptions, prepayment assumptions, and discount rate reasonableness against benchmarks like the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index.</p>

<p><strong>Market Approach:</strong> Recent transactions in the same loan (secondary trades, new issuances) provide strong evidence if orderly and near measurement date. For rated borrowers, CDS spreads, bond spreads, or loan indices provide observable data.</p>

<p><strong>Third-Party Valuations:</strong> Auditors assess specialist qualifications, independence, and methodology. Specialist work provides evidence but doesn't eliminate auditor responsibility to evaluate appropriateness.</p>

<h3>Sensitivity Analysis</h3>

<p>Auditors examine how fair values change with different discount rates, default probabilities, or recovery rates. Significant sensitivity to assumption changes indicates higher estimation uncertainty. Instruments with PIK interest, OID, or equity kickers require specialized valuation techniques.</p>

<h2>Interest Income Verification</h2>

<h3>Interest Income Accrual Testing</h3>

<p>Auditors verify interest income by examining loan agreements for rates and terms, recalculating income based on outstanding balances and days outstanding, and tracing rate changes for floating rate loans to underlying indices. Most new loans now reference SOFR rather than LIBOR, which ceased publication for most tenors in June 2023.</p>

<h3>PIK Interest and OID</h3>

<p>Payment-in-kind interest increases loan principal while recognizing income, creating disconnects between income recognition and cash receipt. Auditors verify PIK is properly added to principal balances and assess whether collectability concerns warrant accrual suspension. Extended PIK periods may indicate borrower financial stress.</p>

<p>Original issue discount (the difference between par and amount funded) is accreted to income using the effective interest method. For example, a $10M par loan funded at 98% contains $200,000 OID. Auditors verify funding documentation, test accretion calculations, and assess prepayment assumptions.</p>

<h3>Nonaccrual Policies</h3>

<p>Funds place loans on nonaccrual when collection becomes doubtful, typically when 90+ days past due. Auditors test that nonaccrual policies are applied consistently and that performing loans with risk indicators are appropriately classified. Delayed nonaccrual recognition is a key audit risk that overstates assets and income.</p>

<h2>BDC Audit Considerations</h2>

<p>BDCs are regulated as investment companies under the 1940 Act, with enhanced audit requirements beyond private LP funds. The <a href="https://www.sec.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SEC</a> oversees BDC registration and ongoing compliance.</p>

<h3>Qualifying Asset Testing</h3>

<p>BDCs must invest at least 70% of total assets in qualifying assets (generally privately held U.S. companies with assets under $4M or net worth under $2M at initial investment). Auditors verify qualifying asset percentages, test classifications, and evaluate whether non-qualifying investments remain within permitted limits.</p>

<h3>Asset Coverage and Leverage</h3>

<p>BDCs may not issue debt if asset coverage falls below 200% (or 150% with shareholder approval). Auditors calculate coverage ratios at period end and after any debt issuances, test senior security classifications, and evaluate whether any breaches were timely cured. Board oversight of valuations receives particular attention—independent directors must approve valuation policies and oversee application.</p>

<h3>RIC Status and Affiliate Transactions</h3>

<p>BDCs electing RIC status must distribute at least 90% of investment company taxable income per <a href="https://www.irs.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IRS</a> requirements. Auditors verify distribution calculations and timing. Section 17 of the 1940 Act restricts transactions between BDCs and affiliated persons—auditors identify affiliates and test transactions for compliance with prohibitions and exemptions.</p>

<h2>Internal Controls and Administrator Coordination</h2>

<p>While private credit funds generally aren't subject to SOX 404, auditors assess controls to determine substantive procedure requirements.</p>

<h3>Fund-Level Controls</h3>

<p>Key controls include management review of NAV calculations and loan reconciliations, pricing validation for illiquid positions, CECL allowance review, interest income oversight including PIK and OID, and nonaccrual monitoring. Document controls through formal policies, checklists with sign-offs, and exception reports.</p>

<h3>Administrator Coordination</h3>

<p>Administrators prepare trial balances, provide transaction documentation, coordinate borrower confirmations, and prepare audit schedules. Fund managers retain responsibility for validating complex valuations, explaining credit events, documenting expense accruals, and evidencing oversight controls.</p>

<h3>SOC Reports</h3>

<p>Administrator SOC 1 Type II reports, governed by <a href="https://www.aicpa.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AICPA</a> standards, cover controls over NAV calculation, trade capture, reconciliation, pricing, and financial reporting. Fund auditors rely on these reports to assess administrator controls. When SOC reports identify deficiencies, evaluate whether compensating fund-level controls are necessary. The <a href="/tools/management-company-budget">Management Company Budget Planner</a> can help project administration and audit-related expenses.</p>

<h2>Audit Timeline Management</h2>

<h3>Critical Milestones</h3>

<p>Typical December 31 year-end timeline: planning meetings in October/November, interim fieldwork September-November, year-end fieldwork mid-to-late January, draft review in February, final report in March (90-day target).</p>

<p>Common delay sources: lagging borrower confirmations, incomplete CECL documentation, control deficiencies requiring remediation, and unresolved Level 3 valuation issues. Proactive management accelerates completion within typical 120-day LPA deadlines.</p>

<h3>Year-Round Documentation</h3>

<p>Maintain organized files throughout the year: loan agreements with amendments, borrower financials and covenant certificates, credit memoranda, valuation documentation, CECL model assumptions, reconciliations, and expense accruals. Electronic filing systems with standardized folder structures and clear naming conventions facilitate efficient audit support.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Audit costs scale with complexity:</strong> Emerging managers typically pay $25,000-$60,000; established mid-sized funds $75,000-$200,000. Big Four firms command 30-50% premiums but provide institutional credibility and deep CECL/fair value expertise. Plan for these costs using the <a href="/tools/management-company-budget">Management Company Budget Planner</a>.</li>

<li><strong>Loan portfolio testing requires comprehensive documentation:</strong> Files should contain executed agreements, security documents, borrower financials, covenant certificates, and valuation support. Auditors employ sampling stratified by loan size, credit quality, and risk characteristics.</li>

<li><strong>CECL validation is the most judgmental audit area:</strong> Maintain detailed documentation of historical loss experience, current portfolio adjustments, economic forecast assumptions, and qualitative factors. Perform regular back-testing comparing estimates to actual experience.</li>

<li><strong>Level 3 fair value requires robust support:</strong> DCF models need documentation for payment terms, credit adjustments, prepayment assumptions, and discount rates. Third-party specialists provide independent support but don't eliminate management responsibility.</li>

<li><strong>Interest income complexity spans multiple areas:</strong> Auditors test floating rate resets (SOFR transition), PIK capitalization, OID accretion, and nonaccrual designation. Delayed nonaccrual recognition is a key audit risk.</li>

<li><strong>BDCs face specialized requirements:</strong> 70% qualifying asset tests, asset coverage ratios, board valuation oversight, Section 17 affiliate restrictions, and RIC distribution requirements (90% of taxable income).</li>

<li><strong>Administrator SOC reports enable control reliance:</strong> Obtain current SOC 1 Type II reports annually and evaluate any deficiencies. Fund managers retain responsibility for complex valuations and oversight evidence.</li>

<li><strong>Year-round documentation prevents year-end scrambles:</strong> Maintain organized files throughout the year with standardized folder structures and clear naming conventions.</li>

<li><strong>Target 90-day completion:</strong> Common delays include lagging confirmations, incomplete CECL documentation, and unresolved valuations. Proactive coordination enables timely distribution within 120-day LPA deadlines.</li>
