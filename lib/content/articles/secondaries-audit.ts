  content: `<p>Annual financial statement audits for secondaries funds involve complexity beyond typical private fund audits due to the portfolio-of-funds structure. Auditors must evaluate valuations across potentially hundreds of underlying positions, assess purchase price allocation methodologies, and verify cash flows from numerous fund interests. Preparing effectively for audits reduces disruption and supports timely completion.</p>

<h2>Audit Scope and Requirements</h2>
<p>Most institutional secondaries funds require annual audited financial statements. The audit scope typically encompasses:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Financial Statements:</strong> Statement of assets and liabilities, statement of operations, statement of changes in partners' capital, and statement of cash flows</li>
<li><strong>Footnote Disclosures:</strong> Including fair value measurement disclosures, significant accounting policies, and related party transactions</li>
<li><strong>Schedule of Investments:</strong> Detailed listing of underlying fund positions with cost basis and fair value</li>
<li><strong>Partner Capital Accounts:</strong> Verification of LP account balances and allocations</li>
</ul>

<p>Partnership agreements typically require audited financials within 90 to 120 days after year-end, though the complexity of secondaries audits sometimes challenges this timeline.</p>

<h2>Valuation Audit Procedures</h2>
<p>Fair value measurement represents the most substantive audit area for secondaries funds. Auditors apply procedures including:</p>

<p>Understanding the valuation methodology used for underlying fund positions, typically based on NAVs reported by underlying GPs adjusted for any subsequent events or information.</p>

<p>Testing the accuracy of underlying NAV data by confirming values directly with underlying fund administrators or GPs, or by obtaining audited financial statements for underlying funds.</p>

<p>Evaluating any adjustments made to reported NAVs based on subsequent information, market conditions, or fund-specific considerations.</p>

<p>Assessing the treatment of purchase discounts or premiums, including whether amortization or other accounting treatment is appropriate and consistently applied.</p>

<p>For larger positions or where underlying fund audits are not yet complete, auditors may perform additional procedures including analytical review of underlying portfolio companies or independent valuation testing.</p>

<h2>Timeliness Challenges</h2>
<p>Secondaries fund audits often face timing constraints because the fund's valuation depends on underlying fund data. Many underlying funds complete their own audits on similar timelines, creating a sequencing challenge where secondaries fund auditors need information that may not yet be finalized.</p>

<p>Common approaches to managing this timing include:</p>

<p>Using estimated or preliminary NAVs for underlying positions, with subsequent procedures to confirm final values when available.</p>

<p>Phasing audit work to complete testing of other areas while awaiting underlying fund information.</p>

<p>Coordinating with underlying fund auditors or administrators to obtain information as early as possible.</p>

<p>In some cases, delaying secondaries fund audit completion until sufficient underlying fund data is available, which may require LP communication about timeline expectations.</p>

<h2>Purchase Accounting Review</h2>
<p>Auditors examine how acquisition transactions are recorded, including:</p>

<p>Verification that purchase prices are accurately recorded and supported by transaction documentation.</p>

<p>Assessment of purchase price allocation methodologies when portfolios of positions are acquired for a single price.</p>

<p>Review of any fair value adjustments made at acquisition, including the basis for any day-one gains or losses recognized.</p>

<p>Testing that acquired positions are properly categorized and disclosed in the schedule of investments.</p>

<h2>Cash Flow Verification</h2>
<p>Given the volume of cash movements in secondaries funds, auditors verify:</p>

<p>Capital calls issued to LPs and the corresponding capital inflows.</p>

<p>Capital calls received from underlying funds and payments made.</p>

<p>Distributions received from underlying funds and the allocation to the secondaries fund.</p>

<p>Distributions made to LPs including proper waterfall application.</p>

<p>Reconciliation of bank statements to recorded cash activity.</p>

<h2>Related Party and Conflict Review</h2>
<p>GP-led continuation vehicles and other transactions involving affiliated parties receive particular audit attention. Auditors assess:</p>

<p>Whether transactions with related parties are identified and disclosed appropriately.</p>

<p>The process for evaluating and approving transactions where potential conflicts exist.</p>

<p>Compliance with partnership agreement provisions regarding conflict situations.</p>

<p>Appropriateness of valuations for related party transactions.</p>

<h2>Audit Preparation Best Practices</h2>
<p>Preparing effectively for audits supports efficiency and timely completion:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Early Communication:</strong> Discuss timing, scope, and potential issues with auditors well before year-end</li>
<li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Begin gathering underlying fund statements and confirmations early in the audit cycle</li>
<li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Maintain organized records of transaction documents, valuation support, and accounting positions</li>
<li><strong>Reconciliations:</strong> Complete bank, partner capital, and portfolio reconciliations before audit fieldwork</li>
<li><strong>Draft Financials:</strong> Prepare draft financial statements and supporting schedules for auditor review</li>
<li><strong>PBC List:</strong> Address items on the auditor's prepared-by-client list promptly and completely</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Audit-Related Responsibilities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Auditor Selection:</strong> Engaging auditors with secondaries fund experience</li>
<li><strong>Planning Coordination:</strong> Working with auditors on scope, timing, and approach</li>
<li><strong>Underlying Data Collection:</strong> Gathering NAV confirmations and financial statements from underlying funds</li>
<li><strong>Valuation Documentation:</strong> Preparing support for fair value measurements and methodologies</li>
<li><strong>Draft Financial Preparation:</strong> Producing draft financial statements and schedules</li>
<li><strong>Issue Resolution:</strong> Addressing questions and clearing review notes during fieldwork</li>
</ul>

<h2>Auditor Selection Considerations</h2>
<p>When selecting auditors, secondaries funds should evaluate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Experience auditing secondaries funds and understanding of the strategy's unique characteristics</li>
<li>Firm resources and industry specialization in private funds</li>
<li>Partner and manager experience with similar engagements</li>
<li>Approach to valuation testing for portfolios of fund interests</li>
<li>Fee structure and staffing approach</li>
<li>Reputation and references from other secondaries managers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Questions to Address for Audit</h2>
<ul>
<li>What is our timeline for collecting underlying fund NAV data, and how does it align with audit schedules?</li>
<li>How do we document our valuation methodology for acquired positions?</li>
<li>What procedures support purchase price allocation across portfolio acquisitions?</li>
<li>How do we handle audit timing when underlying fund audits are not yet complete?</li>
<li>What related party transaction review and documentation processes do we maintain?</li>
<li>How can we improve audit efficiency based on prior year experiences?</li>
