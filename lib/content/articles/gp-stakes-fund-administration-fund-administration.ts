  content: `<p>GP-stakes fund administration involves specialized accounting for management company equity investments tracking cost basis and carrying values, processing distributions from management fees and carried interest with varying timing and character, calculating investor allocations reflecting different economic structures, and reporting portfolio GP business metrics beyond traditional investment returns. Administrators must understand private capital economics, management company operations, and complex distribution waterfalls determining cash flow rights.</p>

<h2>Management Company Investment Accounting</h2>

<p>GP stakes are recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted to fair value based on periodic valuations. Administrators maintain investment records including initial purchase price and acquisition costs establishing basis, ownership percentage determining economic participation, subsequent valuations updating carrying values, and transaction history tracking changes from additional investments or partial realizations. Unlike typical fund investments with quarterly NAVs, management company valuations often occur annually or semi-annually requiring significant judgment. The administrator coordinates with CFO and external valuation specialists ensuring proper documentation supports carrying values.</p>

<h2>Cash Flow and Distribution Processing</h2>

<p>GP-stakes receive cash flows from multiple sources with different characteristics. Management fee distributions typically occur quarterly providing regular income, carried interest distributions from portfolio fund realizations arrive irregularly with significant timing variability, and equity proceeds from stake sales or company dividends occur opportunistically. The administrator processes receipts, allocates cash to investors per fund terms (which may include preferred returns or tiered structures), handles tax withholding when applicable, and tracks distribution components for tax reporting. Accurate processing ensures investors receive entitled cash flows and proper characterization for tax purposes.</p>

<h2>Performance Reporting and Metrics</h2>

<p>Reporting includes both investment returns and portfolio GP business metrics. Investment reporting shows realized and unrealized returns, IRRs, and cash yields from fee distributions. Business metrics track AUM levels and growth, fundraising activity and success, fund performance across portfolio, team size and organizational development, and operating margins and profitability. Comprehensive reporting enables investors to evaluate both financial returns and portfolio GP business trajectory. The administrator sources business metrics from portfolio GP reports ensuring accuracy and consistency.</p>
