  content: `<p>Private credit funds operate within a complex and evolving regulatory framework that demands rigorous compliance protocols and continuous monitoring. The dramatic growth of private credit markets over the past decade—with assets under management exceeding $1.5 trillion globally—has intensified regulatory scrutiny from the <a href="https://www.sec.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Securities and Exchange Commission</a>, prudential regulators, and state authorities. Unlike traditional bank lenders subject to comprehensive banking regulations through the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Reserve oversight, private credit fund managers navigate a hybrid compliance environment combining investment adviser regulations, securities laws, and credit-specific lending requirements that span federal and state jurisdictions.</p>

<p>The regulatory obligations facing private credit fund managers differ meaningfully from those governing traditional private equity or venture capital funds. While all private fund managers must address core Investment Advisers Act requirements including Form ADV disclosure, compliance programs, and books and records maintenance, credit fund managers confront additional layers of complexity stemming from their lending activities. These include compliance with consumer lending laws such as the Truth in Lending Act and Equal Credit Opportunity Act for consumer-focused strategies, commercial lending regulations including state usury limitations and licensing requirements, fair lending requirements prohibiting discriminatory practices, and debt collection laws governing workout and recovery activities. Fund managers providing credit to businesses must understand the Bankruptcy Code and creditor rights to structure loans appropriately and maximize recoveries, while those lending to consumers face the full weight of federal consumer protection statutes and state-level consumer lending regulations.</p>

<p>Compliance excellence in private credit requires understanding multiple regulatory regimes, implementing robust compliance programs tailored to specific lending strategies, maintaining meticulous books and records documenting underwriting and monitoring activities, and fostering a culture of regulatory awareness throughout the organization from deal teams through portfolio management. This article examines the comprehensive regulatory framework applicable to private credit fund managers, addresses lending-specific compliance requirements that distinguish credit funds from other alternative investment strategies, and provides practical guidance for implementing effective compliance programs that enable funds to originate and manage credit portfolios while managing regulatory risk effectively.</p>

<h2>SEC Registration and the Investment Advisers Act Framework</h2>

<p>The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 establishes the foundational regulatory structure governing private credit fund managers. Understanding registration requirements, exemptions, and the obligations that follow registration provides the starting point for credit fund compliance.</p>

<h3>Registration Thresholds and Requirements</h3>

<p>Investment advisers providing advice regarding securities for compensation must register with either the Securities and Exchange Commission or state securities regulators unless they qualify for an exemption. The threshold for SEC registration depends primarily on assets under management. Advisers with at least $100 million in assets under management generally register with the SEC, while smaller advisers register with states where they maintain offices or clients. For advisers managing between $100-150 million in AUM, registration may be optional or required depending on state law requirements.</p>

<p>The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act eliminated the private fund adviser exemption that many hedge fund and private credit advisers previously relied upon. As a result, private credit fund managers generally must register with the SEC once assets under management exceed $150 million. The venture capital fund adviser exemption provides relief for certain venture capital advisers, but this exemption does not apply to credit fund strategies that involve lending rather than equity investing.</p>

<p>Registration as an investment adviser triggers comprehensive compliance obligations under the Advisers Act and SEC rules. These obligations include adopting and implementing written compliance policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of the Advisers Act, designating a chief compliance officer responsible for administering the compliance program, maintaining specified books and records in accordance with Rule 204-2, providing disclosure to investors through Form ADV Parts 1 and 2, and submitting to SEC examination and enforcement authority. The registration process itself requires substantial preparation, with most advisers spending several months compiling required information, drafting disclosure documents, and implementing compliance infrastructure before filing Form ADV through the Investment Adviser Registration Depository system.</p>

<h3>Form ADV Disclosure Requirements</h3>

<p>Form ADV serves as the cornerstone disclosure document for registered investment advisers, providing both regulatory reporting to the SEC and client disclosure to fund investors. The form consists of two primary parts with distinct functions. Part 1 collects standardized operational information through check-boxes, drop-down selections, and numerical entries, filed electronically through IARD. Part 2 requires narrative disclosure written in plain English, serving as the adviser's brochure delivered to clients and made publicly available through the SEC's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure system.</p>

<p>Form ADV Part 1 addresses adviser identification, ownership structure, business operations, and regulatory history through a series of items and schedules. Item 1 requests identifying information including legal name, business names, addresses, and contact information. Items 2 and 3 address SEC and state registration details, form of organization, and fiscal year. Items 5 through 7 collect information about the adviser's business including numbers of employees, client types, assets under management broken down by client category, types of advisory services offered, and participation in client transactions.</p>

<p>For private credit fund managers, several Form ADV Part 1 items merit particular attention. Item 5 requires detailed information about clients and assets under management, with credit fund managers typically reporting substantial assets in the "pooled investment vehicles" category representing private credit funds advised. Item 6 addresses types of advisory services and methods of analysis, with credit fund managers describing lending advisory services and credit analysis methodologies. Item 7 requests information about the adviser's participation or interest in client transactions, relevant when fund managers co-invest alongside funds, provide bridge financing during fund formation, or maintain lending relationships with portfolio companies of affiliated funds.</p>

<p>Section 7.B of Form ADV, completed by all private fund advisers, collects fund-level information for each advised private fund. This section requests basic identification information including fund name and identification numbers, fund type classification, regulatory assets under management, strategy description, beneficial ownership concentration showing the percentage of fund equity held by the five largest beneficial owners, and parallel fund and feeder fund relationships. Private credit fund managers must classify each fund by type, typically selecting "private equity fund" for closed-end credit funds structured similarly to private equity or "other private fund" for open-end or hybrid credit structures. The strategy description should clearly articulate the credit or lending focus, differentiating direct lending, specialty finance, distressed credit, asset-based lending, or other credit strategies.</p>

<p>Form ADV Part 2, the narrative brochure, requires comprehensive disclosure addressing fifteen items covering the adviser's business practices, conflicts of interest, fee structures, and disciplinary history. Item 4 describes the advisory business including ownership structure, types of services offered, client types, and assets under management. Private credit fund managers should provide clear descriptions of lending strategies employed, including whether the adviser originates loans directly, purchases whole loans from origination partners, acquires secondary loans or bonds, or employs multiple sourcing approaches. The description should address target borrower profiles including industry sectors, company sizes, transaction purposes, and credit quality parameters.</p>

<p>Item 5 addresses fees and compensation, requiring detailed disclosure of management fee structures, performance-based compensation arrangements, and other compensation the adviser or related persons receive. Private credit fund managers typically charge management fees calculated as a percentage of committed capital during the investment period and invested capital or net asset value thereafter, with rates commonly ranging from 1.0 to 2.0 percent. Performance compensation structures vary but often include carried interest or incentive allocations of 10 to 20 percent of investment profits subject to preferred return hurdles and loss recovery provisions. The disclosure must explain fee calculation methodologies, timing of fee payments, whether fees may be offset or rebated, and any fee discounts or preferential terms offered to certain investors.</p>

<p>Item 8 requires description of methods of analysis, investment strategies, and material risks. This item creates disclosure obligations specific to private credit fund operations. Credit fund managers should describe underwriting methodologies including financial analysis techniques, collateral valuation approaches, industry due diligence processes, and credit committee decision-making frameworks. The risk disclosure should address material risks specific to credit strategies including default and credit risk, illiquidity and secondary market risk, interest rate and refinancing risk, concentration risk from lending to particular industries or borrower types, subordination risk for mezzanine or junior lenders, and bankruptcy and creditor rights risks affecting recoveries.</p>

<p>Items 10 through 12 address other financial industry activities and affiliations, code of ethics and participation in client transactions, and brokerage practices. Item 10 requires disclosure of related persons engaged in financial activities and material relationships with related persons or other industry participants that create conflicts of interest. Private credit managers should disclose affiliations with loan originators, servicers, or placement agents, relationships with fund investors who may also be borrowers, and arrangements with related parties providing services to funds. Item 11 addresses the adviser's code of ethics governing personal trading, policies regarding adviser or related person investments in securities recommended to clients, and practices regarding principal and agency cross transactions. Item 12 applies primarily to advisers selecting brokers for client securities trades and has limited application to private credit managers unless funds invest in traded credit instruments.</p>

<p>Form ADV must be updated at least annually through an annual updating amendment filed within 90 days of the adviser's fiscal year end. More frequent updates through other-than-annual amendments become necessary whenever information becomes materially inaccurate, such as when disciplinary events occur, ownership changes, or new funds are launched. The annual amendment provides an opportunity to refresh disclosure, update assets under management figures, add new strategies or services, and incorporate policy changes implemented during the year. Well-managed advisers treat the annual amendment as a comprehensive disclosure review rather than a mere compliance exercise, ensuring Form ADV accurately reflects current operations and effectively communicates the adviser's business to investors and regulators.</p>

<h3>Chief Compliance Officer Requirements</h3>

<p>The Investment Advisers Act requires all registered advisers to designate a chief compliance officer responsible for administering the compliance program. The CCO must be competent and knowledgeable regarding the Advisers Act and SEC rules, empowered with appropriate authority and resources to develop and enforce policies, positioned with sufficient independence to provide objective oversight, and granted appropriate access to senior management and boards to escalate compliance issues.</p>

<p>For private credit fund managers, effective CCOs possess expertise spanning traditional investment adviser compliance and credit-specific regulatory considerations. The role requires understanding SEC registration and examination processes, Investment Advisers Act fiduciary duties and prohibitions, marketing and advertising restrictions under the Marketing Rule, Form PF systemic risk reporting requirements, and custody rule compliance. Additionally, credit fund CCOs should understand lending law fundamentals including consumer protection statutes for consumer-focused strategies, state usury laws and commercial lending regulations, bankruptcy and creditor rights affecting loan documentation and workout activities, ERISA plan asset considerations affecting fundraising and lending activities, and anti-money laundering obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act.</p>

<p>Many smaller private credit fund advisers designate a senior professional such as a general counsel, chief operating officer, or head of investor relations as CCO, combining compliance responsibilities with other duties. As organizations grow, dedicated compliance officers provide more effective oversight and signal commitment to regulatory excellence. The CCO should report to the CEO or board rather than to the chief investment officer, creating independence from investment activities and enabling objective evaluation of investment-related compliance risks. Regular access to boards or advisory committees enables the CCO to present compliance reports, discuss regulatory developments, and obtain support for compliance initiatives requiring resource investment.</p>

<h2>Form PF: Systemic Risk Reporting for Credit Funds</h2>

<p>Form PF represents one of the most significant post-crisis regulatory innovations affecting private fund managers. The form collects confidential information regarding private fund strategies, exposures, leverage, liquidity, and performance for use by the Financial Stability Oversight Council in monitoring systemic risk in the financial system.</p>

<h3>Filing Thresholds and Timing Requirements</h3>

<p>Form PF filing obligations depend on an adviser's regulatory assets under management in private funds generally and specific fund types including hedge funds, liquidity funds, and private equity funds. All private fund advisers with at least $150 million in combined private fund assets under management must file Form PF, completing Section 1 which requests basic information applicable to all filers. Advisers with $1.5 billion or more in credit fund assets under management must complete Section 2, which collects substantially more detailed information about private credit strategies, portfolio composition, leverage utilization, and risk exposures.</p>

<p>The threshold for Section 2 reporting treats all "hedge funds" as defined by Form PF together when determining the $1.5 billion credit fund threshold. Form PF defines hedge funds broadly to include any private fund that has a performance fee or allocation calculated by taking into account unrealized gains, may borrow more than a de minimis amount other than for short-term cash management, may sell securities or other assets short, or may enter into derivatives transactions for purposes other than hedging currency risk. This definition encompasses most private credit funds regardless of whether they employ hedge fund-style trading strategies, as credit funds typically utilize leverage through credit facilities or asset-level financing, potentially triggering the hedge fund classification.</p>

<p>However, the instructions to Form PF provide that private equity funds are not hedge funds even if they meet the hedge fund definition. Credit funds structured as closed-end private equity vehicles with capital commitments, multi-year investment periods, and limited partnership governance may classify as private equity funds rather than hedge funds. This classification affects both Section 2 applicability for credit fund strategies and Section 4 applicability for larger private equity-style credit funds. Advisers must carefully evaluate each fund's structure, terms, and strategy against Form PF definitions to determine appropriate classification and resulting reporting obligations.</p>

<p>Large private credit fund advisers classified as hedge fund advisers for Form PF purposes file Section 2 quarterly within 60 days after each calendar quarter end. Smaller advisers filing only Section 1 file annually within 120 days after their fiscal year end. The quarterly filing cadence for large hedge fund advisers creates ongoing operational burden, requiring systems and processes to compile required data each quarter. Late filings or material inaccuracies can result in SEC examination findings, deficiency letters requiring explanation and remediation, and potential enforcement actions for repeated or egregious violations.</p>

<h3>Section 1: Basic Information for All Filers</h3>

<p>Section 1 of Form PF applies to all private fund advisers required to file, requesting information about each private fund advised including identification, classification, size, investor characteristics, and basic portfolio information. Question 6 addresses strategy classification, with advisers selecting the single strategy that best describes each fund's predominant investment approach. Private credit fund managers typically classify funds under credit-related strategy categories including "credit arbitrage" for relative value credit strategies, "distressed" for distressed debt and special situations strategies, "multi-strategy" for funds employing multiple credit approaches, or "other hedge fund strategies" when more specific categories do not apply. The strategy classification provides regulators visibility into the composition of private fund industry assets and enables analysis of flows and performance by strategy type.</p>

<p>Questions 7 through 16 request fund-level information including gross and net asset values calculated according to Form PF specifications, investor contributions and withdrawals during the reporting period, borrowings from banks and other financial institutions, repurchase agreement financing, investment exposures broken down by asset class and geography, derivatives positions measured by notional amounts and gross market values, trading and clearing activities, and counterparty credit exposures. For private credit funds, the asset class breakdown typically shows substantial allocations to "loans" and potentially "structured products" for CLO equity or debt tranches, "bonds" for high-yield bond investments, or "other" for certain specialty finance assets not fitting standard categories.</p>

<p>The beneficial ownership question requests the percentage of fund equity interests held by the five largest beneficial owners measured by equity value. This metric helps regulators assess investor concentration and potential redemption risks if large investors withdraw capital. Private credit funds typically show relatively high concentration given the institutional nature of credit fund investor bases, with pension funds, insurance companies, endowments, and sovereign wealth funds often making substantial commitments representing meaningful percentages of fund equity.</p>

<h3>Section 2: Enhanced Reporting for Large Credit Fund Advisers</h3>

<p>Section 2 of Form PF applies specifically to large hedge fund advisers with at least $1.5 billion in hedge fund assets under management as calculated under Form PF rules. This section collects granular information enabling systemic risk assessment and monitoring of hedge fund industry trends. The information is reported both at the aggregate level across all hedge funds advised and at the fund level for "qualifying hedge funds" defined as hedge funds with net assets of at least $500 million.</p>

<p>Question 17 addresses fund characteristics for each qualifying hedge fund including gross asset value, net asset value, investor concentration showing the percentage of NAV held by the five largest beneficial owners, liquidity terms available to investors including redemption frequencies and notice periods, gates or other withdrawal restrictions, and side pocket or similar arrangements segregating illiquid or distressed assets. For credit funds with open-end or evergreen structures permitting periodic subscriptions and redemptions, these liquidity terms provide important information about potential redemption pressures during stress periods. Credit funds structured as closed-end vehicles without redemption rights present lower redemption risk but may face different challenges if investors seek secondary market sales during distressed conditions.</p>

<p>Questions 18 through 20 address portfolio exposures and financing. Question 18 requests portfolio composition showing long and short exposures broken down by major asset classes including equity, fixed income, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps, and other derivatives. Private credit funds typically report substantial long exposure to fixed income representing direct loans, purchased loans, and bonds, with minimal short exposure unless pursuing relative value or hedging strategies. Question 19 requests information about borrowing and financing including total borrowings from different counterparty types, collateral pledged to counterparties, and rehypothecation of investor assets. Credit funds utilizing subscription lines, warehouse facilities, or asset-level financing to leverage portfolios report these borrowings with appropriate categorization by lender type.</p>

<p>Question 20 addresses exposures to major counterparties including prime brokers, swap dealers, securities lending counterparties, and repo counterparties. This information enables monitoring of interconnectedness between hedge funds and major financial institutions. Private credit funds relying on warehouse financing from banks or engaging in hedging transactions through swap dealers report these relationships, providing regulators visibility into credit fund relationships with the broader financial system.</p>

<p>Questions 21 through 23 focus on risk metrics and trading characteristics. Question 21 requests Value at Risk calculations at specified confidence levels using the adviser's internal VaR model or, if no internal model exists, a standardized approach. Many private credit funds do not calculate VaR as part of regular risk management practices, as VaR methodologies designed for liquid traded portfolios translate imperfectly to illiquid loans with limited price histories. Advisers without VaR models may use Form PF's standardized approach or explain that VaR is not calculated. Question 22 addresses trading and clearing through registered entities including use of derivatives clearing organizations and swap execution facilities. Question 23 requests certain information about portfolio concentration and exposures to specific risk factors.</p>

<h3>Data Collection and Reporting Infrastructure</h3>

<p>Form PF reporting creates substantial data collection, aggregation, and quality assurance challenges for private credit fund managers. The granular position-level data required by Section 2 must be extracted from portfolio management systems, loan administration platforms, and fund accounting records, then transformed to match Form PF's specific data requirements and categorization schemes. Asset class classifications used internally may differ from Form PF categories, requiring mapping logic or manual categorization. Derivatives exposures must be calculated using Form PF notional amount specifications. Borrowing and collateral information must be compiled from credit agreements, warehouse reports, and margin statements.</p>

<p>Large private credit fund advisers typically implement dedicated Form PF reporting infrastructure to manage quarterly filing requirements. This may include data warehouses aggregating position and fund-level data from multiple sources, transformation and calculation engines computing derived fields and cross-fund aggregations, validation controls identifying potential errors or inconsistencies requiring investigation, and workflow systems managing the reporting process from data extraction through filing. Technology vendors offer Form PF reporting solutions providing templates, calculation logic, and filing preparation tools, but substantial customization typically proves necessary to accommodate adviser-specific data sources, fund structures, and reporting requirements.</p>

<p>Smaller advisers filing only Section 1 annually face less intensive data requirements but must still establish processes to collect required information accurately and timely. Many smaller advisers compile Form PF using spreadsheet tools, extracting data from portfolio systems and fund accounting records into templates that calculate required metrics and format responses. The annual filing schedule provides more time for data collection and quality review but requires maintaining institutional knowledge of the process across long gaps between filings. Compliance calendars, written procedures, and documentation of data sources help ensure consistent and accurate completion year over year despite personnel changes or system updates.</p>

<h2>Credit-Specific Regulations: Lending Laws and Compliance</h2>

<p>Private credit fund managers must navigate a complex web of federal and state lending laws governing loan origination, servicing, and collection activities. These regulations, many designed for traditional bank and non-bank consumer and commercial lenders, apply with varying degrees to private credit funds depending on borrower types, loan structures, operational approaches, and jurisdictional factors. Understanding which requirements apply to specific lending activities requires careful legal analysis informed by fund strategy, loan documentation approaches, and regulatory developments.</p>

<h3>Consumer Lending Regulations</h3>

<p>Private credit funds focused on consumer lending face extensive federal consumer protection requirements creating significant compliance obligations. The Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z require standardized disclosure of loan terms, interest rates expressed as annual percentage rates, payment schedules, and total finance charges through specific forms including the Loan Estimate for mortgage loans and the Schumer Box for credit cards. These disclosure requirements apply to creditors regularly extending consumer credit and aim to enable consumers to compare credit terms across lenders and make informed borrowing decisions.</p>

<p>The Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B prohibit discrimination in credit decisions based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or receipt of public assistance income. Lenders must evaluate creditworthiness based on permissible factors such as income, assets, credit history, and debt obligations without considering prohibited bases. When denying credit or taking adverse action, lenders must provide adverse action notices explaining the reasons and informing applicants of their right to obtain credit reports used in the decision. ECOA compliance requires training credit personnel on prohibited bases, documenting credit decisions based on legitimate business factors, and implementing monitoring to identify potential disparate impact.</p>

<p>The Fair Credit Reporting Act regulates consumer reporting agencies and users of consumer reports. Lenders obtaining credit reports for underwriting purposes must have a permissible purpose, comply with adverse action notice requirements when denying credit based on information in credit reports, and provide risk-based pricing notices when offering less favorable terms based on credit information. The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, amending the FCRA, added identity theft prevention requirements and enhanced consumer rights to dispute inaccurate information. Lenders furnishing information to credit reporting agencies must establish reasonable policies and procedures for reporting accurate information and investigating disputes.</p>

<p>The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act restricts tactics and practices debt collectors may employ when collecting consumer debts. While the FDCPA applies primarily to third-party debt collectors rather than original creditors, private credit funds that acquire consumer loans originated by others fall within the definition of debt collectors subject to FDCPA requirements. The FDCPA prohibits harassment, false or misleading representations, and unfair practices in debt collection, specifies times and places where collectors may contact consumers, and grants consumers rights to dispute debts and request validation. Even original creditors not subject to the FDCPA must comply with state debt collection laws, many of which impose requirements similar or more stringent than federal law. Violations of consumer lending laws create private rights of action for statutory damages, actual damages, and attorney's fees, generating class action risk and regulatory enforcement exposure.</p>

<h3>Commercial Lending Regulations</h3>

<p>Private credit funds focused on commercial lending navigate different regulatory terrain with fewer federal requirements but significant state-law considerations. State usury laws limit maximum interest rates that may be charged on loans, with limits varying substantially across states and depending on borrower types, loan amounts, and transaction purposes. Some states maintain relatively low usury caps for consumer loans but permit higher rates for commercial loans. Other states exempt commercial transactions above certain dollar thresholds or loans to business borrowers from usury limitations entirely. States may calculate permissible interest rates differently, with some limiting contract rates, others limiting effective rates including fees, and still others applying the higher of multiple alternative calculations.</p>

<p>The consequences of violating usury laws vary by state but often include forfeiture of interest or interest and principal, rendering loans unenforceable and exposing lenders to borrower claims for return of payments already made. Some states impose civil or criminal penalties for usurious lending. Given these severe consequences, credit fund managers must understand applicable usury limits in each jurisdiction where they lend and structure loans to comply with relevant limitations or qualify for available exemptions. Multi-state lending programs require jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction analysis, as loans are typically subject to the usury law of the state where the borrower resides or where the loan is deemed made under choice-of-law rules.</p>

<p>State lending license requirements pose significant compliance challenges for private credit fund managers engaged in direct loan origination. Many states require lenders to obtain licenses before making loans to borrowers located in the state, with requirements varying based on borrower type, loan amount, security, and purpose. Consumer lending typically requires licensure in nearly all states, with separate license categories for different loan types including mortgage lending, consumer installment lending, and payday or small-dollar lending. Commercial lending license requirements vary more substantially, with some states exempting commercial loans above threshold amounts or loans to business borrowers, while others require licensing for commercial lending activities.</p>

<p>The exemptions from state lending license requirements available to banks and certain other chartered financial institutions under principles of federal preemption generally do not extend to private credit funds. While banks benefit from licensing exemptions and usury law preemption under the National Bank Act and federal banking statutes, private credit funds structured as investment vehicles rather than chartered depository institutions must comply with state licensing and usury requirements applicable to non-bank lenders. However, some states provide statutory exemptions for lenders making limited numbers of loans annually, loans above specified dollar thresholds, or loans to sophisticated borrowers meeting asset or income requirements. Credit fund managers must analyze licensing requirements state by state and either obtain necessary licenses or structure activities to qualify for available exemptions.</p>

<p>Many private credit funds address state lending license burdens through structural approaches that avoid direct loan origination subject to licensing requirements. Common structures include purchasing whole loans originated by licensed lenders rather than originating directly, partnering with licensed originators who make loans and immediately sell participation interests to the fund, or originating through licensed operating company subsidiaries rather than through the fund entity itself. Each approach creates different compliance, operational, and structural considerations requiring careful design and documentation. Funds relying on originator partners must conduct due diligence on partner licensing and compliance capabilities, implement loan purchase agreements allocating regulatory responsibilities, and monitor partner compliance to manage regulatory and reputational risk.</p>

<h2>Bankruptcy Code and Creditor Rights Considerations</h2>

<p>Understanding bankruptcy law and creditor rights represents an essential competency for private credit fund managers. The Bankruptcy Code fundamentally reshapes creditor-debtor relationships during financial distress, imposing restrictions on collection activities, empowering trustees and debtors with avoiding powers, establishing priority schemes affecting distributions, and creating frameworks for reorganization or liquidation that may impair contractual rights. Credit fund managers must structure loan documentation anticipating potential bankruptcy scenarios, monitor portfolio credits for warning signs of financial deterioration, and engage actively in bankruptcy proceedings to protect fund interests and maximize recoveries.</p>

<h3>The Automatic Stay and Collection Restrictions</h3>

<p>Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code imposes an automatic stay upon bankruptcy filing that prohibits virtually all creditor collection activities and enforcement actions without bankruptcy court approval. The stay halts pending lawsuits and administrative proceedings, prevents new lawsuits from being filed, prohibits enforcement of judgments obtained before bankruptcy, stops foreclosure actions and repossessions, prevents setoffs against debtor accounts, and bars even informal collection contacts including demand letters and phone calls. The automatic stay applies immediately upon filing without requiring notice to creditors, though the bankruptcy clerk sends formal notice shortly after filing identifying the case and establishing deadlines for creditor actions.</p>

<p>Violations of the automatic stay, even inadvertent violations due to lack of knowledge of the bankruptcy filing, can result in damages awards compensating debtors for actual losses, punitive damages in egregious cases, and attorneys' fees. Credit fund managers must implement procedures to identify portfolio company bankruptcy filings promptly through monitoring services that search bankruptcy court dockets, Google alerts for company names, periodic borrower certifications, and communications with other lenders or creditors. Upon identifying a bankruptcy, the fund must immediately cease all collection activities, notify portfolio managers and servicers, document the bankruptcy filing in loan files, and begin tracking bankruptcy proceedings.</p>

<p>Secured creditors may seek relief from the automatic stay under Section 362(d) by filing motions in bankruptcy court. Relief may be granted for "cause" including lack of adequate protection of the creditor's interest in collateral, or when the debtor lacks equity in the collateral and the collateral is not necessary for an effective reorganization. Adequate protection requirements obligate debtors to protect secured creditors from diminution in collateral value during bankruptcy through cash payments, additional security, or other means. Relief from stay enables secured creditors to foreclose on collateral under applicable state law, providing exit strategies when debtors cannot reorganize successfully or when collateral values are declining and quick liquidation better preserves creditor recoveries.</p>

<h3>Chapter 7 Liquidation vs. Chapter 11 Reorganization</h3>

<p>Chapter 7 bankruptcies involve liquidation of the debtor's assets by a trustee appointed to collect estate property, sell assets, and distribute proceeds to creditors according to statutory priority. Chapter 7 proceedings move relatively quickly, with asset sales occurring over several months and distributions following shortly after. The distribution priority established by Section 726 pays secured creditors first to the extent of their collateral value, then administrative expenses of the bankruptcy estate, priority unsecured claims including wages and taxes, general unsecured claims, and subordinated claims. Secured creditors often receive substantial recoveries to the extent their collateral covers claim amounts, while general unsecured creditors in undercapitalized companies frequently recover little or nothing.</p>

<p>Chapter 11 reorganizations enable debtors to continue operating while proposing plans to restructure obligations and emerge from bankruptcy. The debtor typically continues managing the business as a "debtor-in-possession" with powers similar to a trustee, though the bankruptcy court may appoint a Chapter 11 trustee in cases involving fraud or gross mismanagement. The reorganization process involves the debtor proposing a plan of reorganization describing how claims will be treated, creditors voting on the plan by class, and the bankruptcy court confirming the plan if it meets statutory requirements including acceptance by requisite majorities and satisfaction of fairness standards.</p>

<p>Creditors vote on reorganization plans by class, with claims grouped into classes based on legal characteristics and proposed treatment. Acceptance requires approval by creditors holding at least two-thirds in dollar amount and more than half in number of claims in each impaired class. Classes receiving full payment or retaining full rights are not impaired and deemed to accept the plan without voting. Classes receiving nothing under the plan are deemed to reject without voting. The court may confirm plans over rejecting classes through "cramdown" procedures if the plan is fair and equitable and does not discriminate unfairly, enabling debtors to impose restructurings on dissenting creditors subject to statutory protections.</p>

<h3>Secured Creditor Rights and Protections</h3>

<p>Secured creditors enjoy significant advantages in bankruptcy stemming from their collateral interests and the protections the Bankruptcy Code provides. Section 506 bifurcates secured claims into secured and unsecured components based on collateral value determined at the petition date. Claims are secured to the extent of collateral value, with any deficiency treated as a general unsecured claim. Undersecured creditors whose collateral value falls short of claim amounts receive secured claim status only for the collateral value, with the deficiency becoming an unsecured claim that typically recovers significantly less. Oversecured creditors whose collateral exceeds claim amounts receive full secured claim treatment and may receive post-petition interest and certain costs and fees to the extent collateral value exceeds the principal claim amount.</p>

<p>Adequate protection requirements obligate debtors using or depleting secured creditors' collateral during bankruptcy to provide protection against diminution in value. This protection may take the form of periodic cash payments, additional or replacement liens, or other relief providing the secured creditor the "indubitable equivalent" of its interest. Undersecured creditors often negotiate cash adequate protection payments or liens on additional collateral as a condition for consenting to continued debtor operations and use of collateral. The adequacy of proposed protection is frequently contested, with secured creditors seeking sufficient protection to prevent value deterioration and debtors arguing that collateral remains adequately protected without additional payments or security.</p>

<p>Secured creditors participate in reorganization plan negotiations from positions of leverage, particularly when oversecured or when collateral is essential to debtor operations. Plans must provide secured creditors deferred cash payments totaling at least the value of their collateral, retention of liens securing such payments, or the "indubitable equivalent" of their claims. This requirement ensures secured creditors receive value equal to their collateral interest even if payment is deferred over time. Secured creditors often negotiate for interest rates on deferred payments exceeding the cramdown rate the court would impose, shorter payment periods, amortization schedules, covenant protections, and continued collateral perfection to maximize value and minimize risk.</p>

<h3>Avoidance Powers and Clawback Risks</h3>

<p>The Bankruptcy Code grants trustees and debtors-in-possession powerful avoidance authorities enabling recovery of certain pre-bankruptcy transfers that improperly advantaged specific creditors or transferred value out of the estate for inadequate consideration. These avoidance powers serve bankruptcy policy objectives of equitable distribution among creditors and preservation of estate assets for creditor benefit, but create clawback risks for credit funds receiving payments or obtaining liens shortly before borrower bankruptcies.</p>

<p>Preference actions under Section 547 permit avoidance of transfers made to creditors within 90 days before bankruptcy filing that were on account of antecedent debts, made while the debtor was insolvent, and that enabled the creditor to receive more than it would receive in a Chapter 7 liquidation. The preference period extends to one year for transfers to insiders including affiliates and principals. Typical targets include debt payments made within the preference period, particularly on long-term obligations rather than ordinary course payables, and liens obtained shortly before bankruptcy to secure existing debts. Preference actions seek to recover the preferential transfer, restoring the creditor to its pre-transfer position as an unsecured or undersecured creditor.</p>

<p>Section 547 includes several defenses protecting ordinary course payments and transactions undertaken in the normal operation of business. The contemporaneous exchange defense protects transfers intended as substantially contemporaneous exchanges for new value, such as cash purchases of goods or services. The ordinary course defense protects payments made in the ordinary course of business according to ordinary business terms, enabling creditors to retain ordinary course payments even if made during the preference period. The subsequent new value defense reduces the amount of a preference by new value the creditor provided to the debtor after receiving the preferential transfer, encouraging continued business relationships during financial distress.</p>

<p>Fraudulent transfer provisions under Section 548 permit avoidance of transfers made within two years before bankruptcy for less than reasonably equivalent value while the debtor was insolvent, was rendered insolvent by the transfer, or was left with unreasonably small capital. Constructive fraudulent transfers need not involve actual fraud but rather turn on inadequate value and indicia of insolvency. Intentional fraudulent transfers made with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors may also be avoided. State fraudulent transfer statutes incorporated into bankruptcy proceedings through Section 544 may permit avoidance of transfers made during longer lookback periods, in some states extending up to six years before bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Credit fund managers mitigate preference and fraudulent transfer risks through several approaches. Loan terms should require payments during the ordinary course rather than extraordinary one-time payments, establishing ordinary course defenses. Documentation should demonstrate contemporaneous exchanges when new loans fund existing debt payoffs. Obtaining security interests and perfecting liens when loans initially fund rather than after a period of delay as an undersecured creditor avoids preference exposure. When negotiating with distressed borrowers, obtaining new value in exchange for accommodations such as lien priorities, guarantee releases, or forbearance eliminates preference vulnerability. Despite careful structuring, some preference exposure may be inevitable, making preference insurance or reserves for potential clawback important risk management considerations.</p>

<h3>Creditor Engagement in Bankruptcy Proceedings</h3>

<p>Private credit funds must engage actively in bankruptcy proceedings to protect interests and influence outcomes. This engagement begins with filing proofs of claim documenting the amount and nature of claims within deadlines established by the bankruptcy court, typically several months after the petition date. Proofs of claim establish creditor status in the case and preserve rights to distributions. Secured creditors must attach documentation supporting the existence and perfection of security interests. Claims are deemed allowed unless objections are filed by the debtor or other parties in interest, triggering contested proceedings to determine claim validity and amount.</p>

<p>Creditors participate in reorganization proceedings by monitoring case developments, appearing at hearings, filing objections to problematic debtor motions, negotiating plan terms, and voting on proposed plans. Official committees of unsecured creditors appointed by the United States Trustee provide structured representation for unsecured creditor constituencies, investigating debtor operations and financial affairs, participating in plan negotiations, and taking positions on significant case issues. Secured creditors often engage directly rather than relying on committee representation, filing motions seeking relief from stay or adequate protection, negotiating directly with debtors regarding collateral use and treatment, and wielding blocking positions on plans that fail to provide adequate treatment.</p>

<p>Experienced bankruptcy counsel becomes essential for effective creditor participation in complex reorganizations. Bankruptcy practice requires specialized expertise in Bankruptcy Code provisions, bankruptcy court procedures, and strategic considerations specific to insolvency proceedings that differ from commercial litigation and business negotiations. Counsel helps credit fund managers assess strategic options, draft and file pleadings and motions, conduct negotiations with debtors and other constituencies, evaluate proposed reorganization plans against statutory requirements and commercial reasonability, and protect creditor interests throughout proceedings that may extend over many months or years. The investment in qualified bankruptcy counsel yields returns through better outcomes, avoided pitfalls, and credibility with courts and opposing parties that benefits negotiations and litigation positions.</p>

<h2>ERISA Considerations for Credit Funds</h2>

<p>The Employee Retirement Income Security Act imposes fiduciary duty standards, prohibited transaction rules, and plan asset regulations that create compliance obligations for private credit fund managers raising capital from pension plans, 401(k) plans, and other benefit plan investors. Understanding ERISA's requirements and structuring funds appropriately to manage ERISA risks represents an essential consideration in fund formation and fundraising activities.</p>

<h3>Prohibited Transactions and Plan Asset Issues</h3>

<p>ERISA Section 406 prohibits specific categories of transactions between benefit plans and parties in interest, broadly defined to include plan fiduciaries, service providers, employers, and their affiliates. Prohibited transactions include sales or exchanges of property between plans and parties in interest, loans or extensions of credit between plans and parties in interest, and furnishing goods or services between plans and parties in interest except under limited service provider exceptions. These restrictions create particular challenges for private credit funds because the fundamental activity of credit funds—making loans and extending credit—constitutes a prohibited transaction if plan assets are involved and borrowers or counterparties are parties in interest to investing plans.</p>

<p>The plan assets regulation under ERISA Section 3(42) determines when a fund's assets are deemed to include plan assets of investing benefit plans, thereby subjecting the fund and fund manager to ERISA's fiduciary duties and prohibited transaction rules. The regulation provides that when a benefit plan acquires an equity interest in an entity, the plan's assets include both the equity interest and an undivided interest in each of the entity's underlying assets, unless an exception applies. If plan assets status applies, the fund manager becomes an ERISA fiduciary subject to duties of prudence and loyalty, fund investments become plan assets subject to prohibited transaction rules, and transactions between the fund and parties in interest to the investing plans may violate ERISA even if otherwise commercially reasonable.</p>

<p>Plan assets treatment creates multiple challenges for private credit fund managers. Fiduciary duty standards require the manager to act solely in the interest of plan participants and beneficiaries, for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits, with appropriate prudence and diligence. Prohibited transaction rules may prevent lending to borrowers who are parties in interest to investing plans, including portfolio companies of affiliated funds or businesses with ownership connections to plan investors or fund managers. ERISA's fee reasonableness requirements may be interpreted to limit management fees and carried interest to amounts reasonable in light of services provided. Violations create personal liability for fiduciaries, excise taxes, potential unwinding of prohibited transactions, and plaintiffs' attorney fee awards, making ERISA risk management essential.</p>

<h3>Plan Asset Exceptions: VCOC and REOC</h3>

<p>The plan assets regulation includes several exceptions enabling funds to avoid plan asset status despite having benefit plan investors. The venture capital operating company exception provides the most commonly invoked exception for private equity and certain credit funds. An entity qualifies as a VCOC if at least 50 percent of its assets valued at cost are invested in venture capital investments (equity interests in operating companies with respect to which the entity has management rights) or operating companies, the entity has the right to substantially participate in or influence the conduct of the management of each portfolio company, and the entity in fact participates or influences management.</p>

<p>While the VCOC exception was designed for venture capital and private equity funds making control equity investments with active management engagement, some private credit fund structures qualify under the exception's flexibility. Credit funds making loans to portfolio companies in which the fund also holds equity interests with management rights may qualify if the portfolio companies constitute operating companies rather than investment vehicles and the fund exercises its management rights through board participation or similar involvement. Unitranche loans, mezzanine investments, or debt with equity kickers held in structures permitting the fund to exercise management rights over borrowers may enable VCOC qualification. However, credit funds making non-control loans without governance rights or management participation typically cannot satisfy VCOC requirements, as the debt investments do not constitute venture capital investments under the definition and passive lending does not involve the requisite management participation.</p>

<p>The real estate operating company exception offers an alternative for private credit funds focused on real estate lending. An entity qualifies as a REOC if at least 50 percent of its assets valued at cost are invested in real estate, and the entity is engaged directly in real estate management or development. Real estate credit funds originating construction loans with active involvement in development activities, making loans to real estate projects in which the fund also holds equity interests, or otherwise combining lending with management or development participation may structure to qualify as REOCs. Passive mortgage lenders providing senior mortgage financing without development involvement typically cannot meet the REOC test, as passive lending does not constitute real estate management or development activity.</p>

<h3>The 25 Percent Threshold Approach</h3>

<p>Many private credit funds that cannot qualify for VCOC or REOC exceptions instead limit benefit plan investor participation to avoid plan asset status. Under the plan assets regulation, an entity's assets are not deemed to include plan assets if benefit plan investors hold less than 25 percent of the value of each class of equity interests, excluding equity held by persons with discretionary authority over the entity's assets, the entity itself, and certain related persons. This exception enables funds to accept plan investor capital below the 25 percent threshold without becoming subject to plan asset regulations and resulting ERISA constraints.</p>

<p>Calculating whether the 25 percent threshold is satisfied requires careful analysis. The test is applied separately to each class of equity interests, such that funds with multiple share classes must ensure benefit plan investors hold less than 25 percent of each class. The numerator includes all plan investor equity, broadly defined to encompass pension plans, profit-sharing plans, 401(k) plans, IRAs, Keogh plans, and foreign plans covered by Similar Law. The denominator includes all equity interests other than those held by the manager, the fund itself, and certain affiliated persons excluded from the calculation. The test is applied based on fair market value as of the initial fund closing and recalculated periodically thereafter, requiring ongoing monitoring of plan investor percentages.</p>

<p>Funds relying on the 25 percent threshold typically include provisions in limited partnership agreements or subscription documents to manage plan investor participation. These provisions may establish aggregate caps on plan investor commitments preventing total plan investor equity from approaching or exceeding 25 percent, grant the general partner authority to reject subscriptions from plan investors if accepting would cause the threshold to be exceeded, require pro rata partial redemptions or rejections if plan investor participation exceeds 25 percent, or permit the general partner to create separate share classes, feeder funds, or parallel vehicles segregating plan investors to ensure the threshold is not exceeded in the primary fund. Subscription documents typically require investors to represent regarding plan investor status and notify the fund of any changes in status enabling funds to track plan investor participation accurately.</p>

<h3>Prohibited Transaction Exemptions</h3>

<p>For credit funds subject to ERISA because they cannot avoid plan asset status, prohibited transaction exemptions provide critical relief enabling certain transactions that would otherwise violate Section 406. Prohibited Transaction Exemption 2006-16 permits certain loan transactions between ERISA plans and parties in interest provided specific conditions are met. The exemption covers loans to parties in interest at interest rates and on terms that are at least as favorable to the plan as those prevailing for comparable loans between unrelated parties, loans fully secured by collateral whose value equals or exceeds loan amounts, and transactions satisfying other conditions regarding plan fiduciary independence, arm's-length negotiations, and documentation.</p>

<p>The Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption provides broader relief for plans whose assets are managed by qualified professional asset managers. QPAMs include certain investment advisers, banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions meeting specified asset and equity thresholds, which are independent of parties in interest to the plan, and which exercise discretionary authority over plan investments. When a QPAM manages plan assets, certain transactions between the plan and parties in interest are exempt from prohibited transaction prohibitions if specific conditions are satisfied including the QPAM's independence from the party in interest and the transaction's commercial reasonableness.</p>

<p>Private credit fund managers should work closely with ERISA counsel to analyze whether specific contemplated transactions qualify for available exemptions and ensure compliance with exemption conditions. Many exemptions require specific documentation, procedural safeguards, and structural requirements that must be satisfied for the exemption to apply. Inadvertent prohibited transactions may be correctable through voluntary compliance programs operated by the Department of Labor, but prevention through careful planning and exemption compliance represents the superior approach avoiding investigation risk, excise tax exposure, and reputational concerns.</p>

<h2>Anti-Money Laundering and Bank Secrecy Act Compliance</h2>

<p>The Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to implement programs designed to detect and prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. While BSA requirements historically focused on banks and other deposit-taking institutions, FinCEN has extended certain requirements to investment advisers, necessitating AML compliance programs and customer due diligence for private credit fund managers.</p>

<h3>AML Program Requirements for Investment Advisers</h3>

<p>In 2015, FinCEN issued final rules subjecting registered investment advisers to BSA requirements for the first time. The rules apply to SEC-registered investment advisers and certain state-registered advisers required to register with the SEC but exempt under available exemptions. Covered advisers must establish anti-money laundering programs reasonably designed to prevent the adviser from being used for money laundering or terrorist financing. The AML program must be risk-based, tailored to the adviser's business model and customer relationships, and must include policies, procedures, and internal controls reasonably designed to achieve compliance, designation of a compliance officer responsible for implementing and monitoring the program, ongoing employee training appropriate to employees' functions, and independent testing of program effectiveness.</p>

<p>The AML program rule for investment advisers is notably more limited than BSA requirements applicable to banks or broker-dealers. Investment advisers are not required to file suspicious activity reports, though some advisers implement voluntary SAR reporting as a best practice. Advisers are not subject to formal customer identification program requirements mandating identity verification procedures, though prudent advisers implement CDD processes functionally similar to bank CIP requirements. The absence of these requirements reflects FinCEN's acknowledgment that investment advisory relationships differ from deposit and transactional banking relationships, presenting different money laundering risk profiles requiring tailored regulatory approaches.</p>

<h3>Customer Due Diligence and OFAC Screening</h3>

<p>Customer due diligence for private credit funds focuses on identifying and verifying fund investors and, for funds engaged in direct lending, borrowers. Effective CDD programs collect beneficial ownership information identifying individuals owning 25 percent or more of entity investors and individuals with control over entity investors, screen investors and borrowers against government sanctions lists including OFAC's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list, assess customer risk profiles based on factors including geography, business activities, ownership structures, and transaction patterns, and conduct enhanced due diligence for higher-risk customers including politically exposed persons, customers from higher-risk jurisdictions, and customers with complex ownership structures potentially obscuring beneficial ownership.</p>

<p>OFAC compliance constitutes a critical component of AML programs that extends beyond investment advisers to all U.S. persons and entities. OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries, regimes, terrorists, narcotics traffickers, and other threats to national security. OFAC's SDN list identifies individuals and entities with whom U.S. persons generally may not transact, with transactions involving SDN list persons subject to blocking requirements and reporting to OFAC. The list is frequently updated, requiring screening against current versions rather than static snapshots.</p>

<p>Private credit fund managers must screen fund investors, borrowers, counterparties, and service providers against the SDN list before establishing relationships and periodically thereafter to identify new designations. Screening should compare names, addresses, and identifying information against SDN list entries, with matching logic calibrated to identify potential matches while managing false positive rates. Many advisers utilize specialized screening software or services that maintain current OFAC lists, perform fuzzy logic matching to identify potential hits despite name variations or misspellings, and provide workflow tools for investigating and resolving potential matches. True matches require blocking assets, rejecting transactions, and filing reports with OFAC documenting the blocking action.</p>

<p>For credit funds engaged in trade finance, supply chain financing, cross-border lending, or lending to borrowers with international operations, AML and OFAC compliance assumes heightened complexity and importance. International transactions present elevated money laundering risks due to cross-jurisdictional fund flows, potentially weaker AML controls in certain jurisdictions, and difficulty tracing ultimate beneficial ownership across multiple countries with varying transparency standards. Sanctions compliance requires understanding not only U.S. sanctions administered by OFAC but also United Nations sanctions, European Union sanctions, and sanctions programs maintained by other countries, particularly when fund investors or borrowers have international nexuses creating exposure to multiple regulatory regimes. Managers of internationally focused credit funds should implement robust AML programs with specialized expertise in international compliance, potentially including dedicated AML personnel, relationships with international screening databases and intelligence services, and enhanced due diligence procedures for cross-border transactions.</p>

<h2>Marketing and Advertising Restrictions</h2>

<p>The Investment Advisers Act and SEC rules impose restrictions on investment adviser marketing and advertising communications that private credit fund managers must observe when soliciting investors. The Marketing Rule, adopted by the SEC in 2020 and effective November 2021, substantially revised the regulatory framework governing adviser advertisements, testimonials, endorsements, and performance presentations, replacing previous per se prohibitions with principles-based requirements focused on preventing materially misleading communications.</p>

<h3>Advertisement Definition and General Prohibitions</h3>

<p>The Marketing Rule defines "advertisement" broadly to include any direct or indirect communication an investment adviser makes to more than one person offering advisory services or promoting advisory capabilities. This expansive definition encompasses traditional advertisements including print ads, radio and television commercials, and billboard advertising, as well as digital communications including websites, social media posts, blog articles, and email newsletters, group presentations to potential investors at conferences or roadshows, marketing materials left with prospective investors, and pitch books distributed to multiple recipients. Virtually all communications with prospective investors about private credit funds constitute advertisements subject to Marketing Rule requirements unless delivered one-on-one to a single recipient.</p>

<p>The rule prohibits advertisements that include any untrue statement of material fact or that are otherwise materially misleading. Whether an advertisement is materially misleading depends on the overall context considering the sophistication of the intended audience, the types of services offered, whether the information is presented in a format that makes it difficult to understand or obscures important information, and whether the inclusion of different or additional information would make the advertisement not misleading. This principles-based standard requires advisers to evaluate marketing materials holistically rather than checking boxes on specific technical requirements, assessing whether a reasonable investor receiving the communication would be misled regarding material information about the adviser's services, capabilities, performance, or other relevant factors.</p>

<p>Specific prohibitions address practices the SEC considers inherently or presumptively misleading. Advertisements may not include untrue or misleading statements about the adviser, its services, or its track record. Advertisements may not include unsubstantiated claims about the benefits or features of services or the characteristics or qualifications of the adviser. Advertisements may not include material information in footnotes or disclaimers that should be disclosed prominently in the body of the advertisement. Advertisements may not present information in a format that makes it difficult to understand or that obscures important information. These prohibitions require marketing materials to present balanced, substantiated, and clearly communicated information rather than promotional claims lacking support or failing to address material limitations and risks.</p>

<h3>Performance Advertising Requirements</h3>

<p>Performance advertising represents a central component of private credit fund marketing, making the Marketing Rule's performance presentation requirements particularly important for fund managers. The rule permits performance advertising subject to specific conditions designed to ensure performance is presented in a manner that is fair, balanced, and not misleading. Gross and net performance must both be presented, with net performance calculated after deduction of fees and expenses that reduce returns to investors. Presenting only gross performance violates the rule because gross performance overstates returns that investors actually realize after paying fees.</p>

<p>The calculation methodology for performance must be disclosed, with time-weighted returns generally appropriate for liquid funds with frequent flows and internal rate of return methodologies common for closed-end private funds. Multiple performance periods should be shown to avoid cherry-picking favorable time periods, with one-year, three-year, five-year, and since-inception returns providing meaningful context about performance across different market environments. Material facts and assumptions underlying performance must be disclosed, including the impact of leverage on returns, assumptions regarding reinvestment of income, impact of fund-of-funds structures or other layered fees, and any other factors materially affecting the presented performance.</p>

<p>Related performance requirements prohibit cherry-picking portfolios or funds when presenting performance. When presenting performance for any portfolio, the adviser must include performance for all portfolios with substantially similar investment policies, objectives, and strategies over the time period presented, subject to limited exceptions for immaterial exclusions or specific types of carved-out performance permitted with appropriate disclosure. This requirement prevents advisers from showing only successful funds while excluding underperforming funds with similar strategies, which would create misleading impressions about the adviser's typical results. The "substantially similar" standard focuses on whether a reasonable investor would view portfolios as pursuing comparable strategies, even if the portfolios have differences in implementation details, leverage levels, or other factors.</p>

<p>Extracted performance showing a subset of investments from a broader portfolio faces heightened requirements under the Marketing Rule. Extracted performance can be highly misleading if it highlights successful investments while ignoring unsuccessful ones from the same portfolio. The rule permits extracted performance only if the adviser maintains records supporting the extraction methodology and demonstrating that the extracted performance fairly reflects the skill of the adviser. Many advisers avoid extracted performance altogether given compliance burdens and potential challenges to the fairness of extraction methodologies during SEC examinations or investor due diligence.</p>

<p>Predecessor performance and related performance create additional considerations. Predecessor performance showing results achieved at a prior firm may be presented if the personnel primarily responsible for the performance now work at the current firm and similar investment processes are used. Related performance of separate accounts or other vehicles managed with similar strategies may be presented subject to requirements regarding inclusion of all substantially similar portfolios. Both predecessor and related performance require careful disclosure of material differences in structure, fees, constraints, or market conditions that may affect comparability to the current fund being marketed.</p>

<h3>Testimonials, Endorsements, and Third-Party Ratings</h3>

<p>The Marketing Rule permits use of testimonials and endorsements but requires specific disclosures and conditions. Testimonials include statements by current or former clients about their experience with the adviser or regarding the adviser's services, performance, or any aspect of the adviser's business. Endorsements include similar statements by non-clients, including consultants, gatekeepers, or industry experts. When using testimonials or endorsements, advisers must disclose that the testimonial was provided by a current client if applicable, that compensation was provided for the testimonial if applicable, and any material conflicts of interest the person providing the testimonial has regarding the adviser or its services.</p>

<p>Advisers must have a reasonable basis for believing that testimonials and endorsements are not materially misleading considering the person's experience, satisfaction with the adviser's services, and whether statements are representative of typical client experiences. Testimonials highlighting exceptional returns during favorable periods without context about typical results or highlighting unusual service experiences not generally available to all clients could mislead prospective investors. Advisers should evaluate whether additional disclosure or context is necessary to prevent testimonials from creating unrealistic expectations or misrepresenting the adviser's capabilities or typical results.</p>

<p>Third-party ratings and rankings may be included in advertisements only if the adviser has a reasonable basis to believe that the rating or ranking was prepared according to methodology that treats all advisers equally, such that participation was equally easy for all advisers. This requirement addresses concerns that some ratings and rankings operate as paid placements disguised as objective assessments, with advisers paying fees or providing information access in exchange for favorable positioning. Advisers using industry rankings should verify the ranking methodology, evaluate whether participation involves payment beyond reasonable administrative fees, and disclose material information about the ranking methodology that may affect how prospective investors interpret the ranking's significance.</p>

<h3>Compliance and Recordkeeping</h3>

<p>The Marketing Rule includes books and records requirements specific to advertisements. Advisers must retain copies of all advertisements disseminated directly or indirectly, including the dates of first and last use. For advertisements containing performance results, advisers must maintain information supporting the performance shown including underlying calculations, time periods used, and assumptions made. For advertisements containing testimonials or endorsements, advisers must maintain records showing the source of the testimonial, any compensation provided, and documentation of required disclosures. These records must be maintained for five years from the last use of the advertisement, with the first two years in an easily accessible place such as the adviser's principal office.</p>

<p>Many credit fund advisers implement advertisement approval processes requiring compliance review before dissemination. Compliance personnel review proposed marketing materials for balanced presentation without unsupported claims, required performance calculation methodologies and disclosures, testimonial and endorsement compliance, and absence of materially misleading statements or presentations. Maintaining centralized advertisement archives organized by material type, distribution date, and retention expiration supports recordkeeping compliance and enables efficient production during SEC examinations. Periodic reviews of websites, social media accounts, and marketing collateral help identify outdated materials requiring updates or revisions to reflect current information and regulatory requirements.</p>

<h2>Books and Records Requirements</h2>

<p>Rule 204-2 under the Investment Advisers Act establishes comprehensive books and records requirements that registered investment advisers must maintain to enable SEC examination of compliance with securities laws and verification of information provided in regulatory filings and investor disclosures. Private credit fund managers must maintain numerous categories of records documenting adviser operations, fund activities, investment decisions, and compliance functions.</p>

<h3>Core Books and Records</h3>

<p>Core books and records required by Rule 204-2 include true, accurate, and current account records for each client showing the client's name and address, investment objectives if known, and securities transactions. For private credit funds, client records encompass detailed information about each fund advised including the limited partnership agreement, offering memorandum and subscription documents, investor lists with capital commitment and ownership information, and correspondence with investors. Transaction records must document all loan originations, purchases, sales, and restructurings with information including transaction date, counterparty, amount, terms, and pricing sufficient to reconstruct each transaction.</p>

<p>Financial records constitute another critical category. Advisers must maintain all bills, invoices, receipts, and other records evidencing all amounts received or paid by the adviser. This includes bank statements, cancelled checks, wire confirmations, invoices from service providers, and documentation supporting fee calculations and expense allocations. Private credit fund managers must maintain detailed records supporting management fee calculations including committed capital or NAV amounts used as fee bases, performance fee calculations including gross and net returns by investor and application of hurdles or loss recovery provisions, and expense allocations among funds and between advisers and funds with documentation of allocation methodologies.</p>

<p>Communications records present particular operational challenges in modern practice. Rule 204-2 requires preservation of originals or copies of all written communications sent or received relating to the adviser's business, including emails, instant messages, text messages, and social media communications. The proliferation of communication channels and devices creates substantial compliance burden, as advisers must implement systems to capture and preserve business communications across email systems, messaging platforms, personal devices used for business, and any other channels employees utilize. Email archiving systems provide automated capture for email communications, while messaging and text communications may require special capture software or mobile device management systems enabling business communication preservation from personal devices.</p>

<h3>Credit-Specific Documentation</h3>

<p>For private credit fund managers, loan-specific documentation must be maintained meticulously in organized loan files. Required documentation includes credit agreements, promissory notes, security agreements, guarantees, intercreditor agreements, subordination agreements, and all amendments, waivers, and modifications. Underwriting documentation including financial statements analyzed, credit memoranda prepared, credit committee presentations and approvals, and supporting due diligence materials should be preserved. Ongoing monitoring records including borrower financial statement deliveries, compliance certificate reviews, covenant compliance testing, and portfolio monitoring analyses document the adviser's fulfillment of ongoing credit management responsibilities.</p>

<p>Default and workout documentation assumes particular importance when loans become troubled. Files should include notices of default, borrower communications regarding financial difficulties, forbearance agreements, amendment agreements providing relief, restructuring documentation, and workout correspondence. For loans that end in foreclosure, bankruptcy, or litigation, documentation of the adviser's efforts to maximize recoveries and protect fund interests provides important records of prudent creditor actions. Well-organized loan files enable advisers to respond quickly to investor inquiries about specific credits, support valuation determinations with documented credit quality assessments, and defend credit decisions and workout strategies during SEC examinations or investor disputes.</p>

<h3>Retention Periods and Electronic Storage</h3>

<p>Retention periods for books and records vary by record type, with most records subject to a five-year retention period measured from the end of the fiscal year during which the last entry was made. The first two years of the retention period must be in an "easily accessible place," interpreted to mean the adviser's principal office or a readily available electronic storage system. Communications must be maintained for five years from the date sent or received. Certain records including partnership agreements, articles of incorporation, minute books, and stock certificate books must be maintained for the life of the entity plus specified periods thereafter.</p>

<p>Electronic storage of books and records is expressly permitted under Rule 204-2(g) subject to specified conditions. Records may be maintained electronically if the adviser arranges for appropriate security, establishes procedures to maintain records in non-rewriteable, non-erasable format preserving record integrity, verifies periodically the quality and accuracy of electronic storage media and maintains capacity to access records, establishes an audit system recording when and by whom records were created and accessed, and implements business continuity and disaster recovery plans addressing electronic record preservation and accessibility during disruptions.</p>

<p>Most modern private credit fund advisers maintain records electronically using document management systems, email archiving platforms, and data warehouses aggregating information from multiple operational systems. Electronic storage provides substantial benefits including remote accessibility, rapid search and retrieval, reduced physical storage costs, and disaster recovery capabilities. However, systems must satisfy Rule 204-2(g)'s specific requirements, particularly regarding write-once-read-many storage preventing alteration of original records, audit trails documenting access and modifications, and backup and recovery capabilities tested periodically to verify functionality.</p>

<h2>Compliance Program Requirements and Annual Review</h2>

<p>Rule 206(4)-7 under the Advisers Act requires registered investment advisers to adopt and implement written compliance policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of the Advisers Act and rules. The rule also requires designation of a chief compliance officer responsible for administering the program and conducting annual reviews of program adequacy and effectiveness.</p>

<h3>Core Compliance Program Elements</h3>

<p>Effective compliance programs for private credit fund managers address multiple topic areas spanning general investment adviser compliance and credit-specific considerations. Portfolio management policies should document credit underwriting standards including minimum borrower financial metrics, maximum leverage levels, collateral coverage requirements, industry and geographic concentration limits, and credit committee approval thresholds for different transaction sizes or risk profiles. These standards ensure consistent credit decisions aligned with fund investment guidelines and risk parameters disclosed to investors.</p>

<p>Conflict of interest policies identify potential conflicts and establish management procedures. Conflicts common to credit fund managers include allocation of lending opportunities among multiple funds managed by the adviser with different strategies or return profiles, co-investment by the adviser or its personnel alongside funds, financing relationships between funds and portfolio companies of affiliated private equity funds, and business relationships with borrowers, origination partners, or service providers. Policies should address each conflict type through disclosure to investors and advisory boards, approval processes for conflicted transactions, allocation methodologies preventing unfair advantage to particular funds or investors, and independent oversight of conflicted transactions through advisory committees or independent valuations.</p>

<p>Valuation policies assume heightened importance for private credit funds holding illiquid loans marked at fair value. Policies should describe valuation methodologies applied to different credit types, establish hierarchies preferring market quotations when available before resorting to model-based valuations, document the use and oversight of third-party valuation specialists, create procedures for investigating pricing discrepancies between different sources, and establish governance structures such as valuation committees to oversee fair value determinations and resolve pricing questions. Consistent application of stated valuation policies, documentation of significant valuation judgments, and periodic testing of valuations against subsequent realizations or independent appraisals provide evidence of prudent valuation practices.</p>

<p>Marketing and performance advertising policies ensure compliance with the Marketing Rule. Policies should address required performance calculation methodologies, gross and net return presentations, inclusion of all portfolios with substantially similar strategies, disclosures accompanying performance presentations, approval procedures for advertisements before dissemination, substantiation requirements for claims about adviser capabilities or experience, and testimonial and endorsement procedures. Compliance review of marketing materials before distribution provides quality control and regulatory compliance verification.</p>

<p>Additional policy areas include books and records maintenance documenting retention obligations and electronic storage procedures, privacy and information security protecting investor information and fund data, business continuity and disaster recovery ensuring operational resilience, personal securities transaction preclearance and reporting preventing conflicts and misuse of information, gifts and entertainment limits and reporting addressing commercial bribery and corruption risks, and custody rule compliance addressing annual audits and investor account statement delivery.</p>

<h3>Annual Review Process and Documentation</h3>

<p>The chief compliance officer must conduct an annual review of the compliance program's adequacy and effectiveness, providing a written report to senior management or the board. The annual review should assess whether policies and procedures remain reasonably designed to prevent violations given current business activities, regulatory requirements, and identified risks, evaluate whether personnel are following established procedures in practice rather than merely documenting policies not actually implemented, identify compliance issues or violations that occurred during the year including root cause analysis and remediation, recommend policy updates addressing identified weaknesses, emerging risks, or regulatory developments, and assess adequacy of compliance resources including personnel, technology systems, and budgets.</p>

<p>The review process typically involves testing specific controls through sampling transactions and activities, interviewing personnel about their understanding and application of policies, reviewing exception reports and compliance metrics, analyzing regulatory developments including new rules, SEC examination priorities, and enforcement actions affecting the industry, and benchmarking practices against peers and industry standards. Testing might examine credit approval documentation to verify credit committee procedures were followed, review loan files to assess documentation completeness, analyze fee calculations to verify accuracy, test marketing materials to confirm compliance review occurred before distribution, and evaluate personal trading preclearance records to ensure employees obtained required approvals.</p>

<p>Documentation of the annual review provides critical evidence of compliance program effectiveness during SEC examinations. The written report should describe the review scope and methodology, summarize testing performed and findings identified, document significant compliance issues or violations that occurred with explanations of causes and remediation undertaken, detail policy enhancements recommended with rationale and implementation timelines, and include assessment of resource adequacy and recommendations for additional investment. Many advisers present annual review reports to advisory boards or independent directors, documenting the presentation in meeting minutes and board consideration of recommended actions. Board engagement signals appropriate governance and enables advisers to obtain support for compliance initiatives requiring funding or operational changes.</p>

<h3>Program Evolution and Continuous Improvement</h3>

<p>Compliance programs must evolve continuously as businesses change, strategies develop, and regulations advance. Private credit fund managers launching new lending strategies should update policies to address strategy-specific risks including new borrower types, collateral categories, or jurisdictions requiring different compliance considerations. Expansions into new geographies may trigger licensing requirements, local lending law compliance, or cross-border transaction considerations requiring policy updates. Service provider changes such as new administrators, auditors, or valuation firms necessitate updated policies addressing oversight and communication with new providers.</p>

<p>Regulatory developments provide important inputs for policy evolution. SEC examination priorities announced through the Division of Examinations' annual examination priorities letter highlight areas receiving examination focus and often signal compliance weaknesses the SEC has identified industry-wide. Risk alerts published by the Division of Examinations provide specific guidance on common compliance deficiencies and best practices. Enforcement actions against other advisers demonstrate regulatory interpretation of requirements and consequences of violations. Compliance officers should monitor these developments systematically and evaluate implications for their advisers' policies and practices, implementing enhancements proactively rather than waiting for examination findings to identify deficiencies.</p>

<p>Industry developments and evolving practices also inform program improvements. As the private credit industry matures and standardizes, certain practices become baseline expectations even without explicit regulatory requirements. Participating in industry associations, attending compliance conferences, and consulting with legal counsel and consultants about emerging practices help compliance officers understand peer approaches and identify potential enhancements. However, policies should remain tailored to the specific adviser's business rather than mechanically adopting templates or peer practices that may not fit the organization's structure, strategy, or risk profile. The most effective compliance programs balance standardization of fundamental controls with customization reflecting unique business characteristics and risk exposures.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>SEC registration triggers comprehensive compliance obligations specific to credit strategies:</strong> Private credit fund managers with $150 million or more in assets under management must register with the SEC and implement compliance programs addressing both traditional investment adviser requirements and credit-specific considerations including lending law compliance, bankruptcy and creditor rights, and loan documentation standards.</li>

<li><strong>Form ADV disclosure must accurately describe credit strategies and risks:</strong> Part 2 brochures should provide clear explanations of lending approaches, underwriting standards, borrower types, credit analysis methodologies, and material risks specific to credit investing including default risk, illiquidity, concentration, and bankruptcy risks distinguishing credit funds from equity-focused private funds.</li>

<li><strong>Form PF systemic risk reporting demands robust data infrastructure:</strong> Large credit fund advisers with $1.5 billion or more in hedge fund assets file quarterly Section 2 reports requiring granular position-level data, risk metrics, and exposure information compiled from portfolio systems, loan administration platforms, and accounting records, necessitating dedicated reporting systems for managers crossing the threshold.</li>

<li><strong>Lending laws create multi-jurisdictional compliance complexity:</strong> Credit fund managers must navigate federal consumer protection statutes for consumer lending strategies, state usury laws limiting permissible interest rates, state licensing requirements varying by jurisdiction and borrower type, and fair lending prohibitions, with licensing and usury compliance often addressed through structural approaches including originator partnerships and whole loan purchases.</li>

<li><strong>Bankruptcy Code knowledge is essential for loan structuring and workout management:</strong> Understanding automatic stay restrictions, Chapter 7 liquidation versus Chapter 11 reorganization dynamics, secured creditor protections and adequate protection requirements, preference and fraudulent transfer avoidance risks, and creditor participation in bankruptcy proceedings enables credit fund managers to structure protective loan documentation, monitor early warning signs, and engage effectively in workouts.</li>

<li><strong>ERISA plan asset considerations affect fundraising and lending activities:</strong> Credit funds accepting pension and benefit plan capital must either qualify for VCOC or REOC exceptions, limit plan investors below 25 percent to avoid plan asset status, or accept ERISA fiduciary status and prohibited transaction restrictions affecting lending to parties in interest, with most funds limiting plan participation or structuring for VCOC qualification when feasible.</li>

<li><strong>The Marketing Rule requires balanced performance presentation:</strong> Credit fund marketing materials must present both gross and net performance, include all portfolios with substantially similar strategies without cherry-picking favorable funds, disclose calculation methodologies and material assumptions, and provide required disclosures for testimonials and endorsements, with compliance review before dissemination ensuring regulatory adherence.</li>

<li><strong>Books and records requirements demand meticulous loan file documentation:</strong> Credit fund managers must maintain comprehensive loan files including credit agreements, security documents, underwriting analyses, credit committee approvals, monitoring records, and workout correspondence, with organized files supporting SEC examination responses, valuation determinations, and defense of credit decisions.</li>

<li><strong>Compliance programs require credit-specific policies beyond generic templates:</strong> Effective programs address credit underwriting standards, loan approval processes, conflict management for opportunity allocation among funds, illiquid loan valuation methodologies, default management procedures, and integration of lending law compliance, with policies tailored to specific strategies rather than importing generic private equity or hedge fund templates.</li>

<li><strong>Chief compliance officers need expertise spanning adviser regulation and credit operations:</strong> Credit fund CCOs should understand both Investment Advisers Act requirements and lending-specific considerations including consumer protection laws, commercial lending regulations, bankruptcy and creditor rights, ERISA restrictions, and credit market practices, with this dual expertise enabling identification of risks at the intersection of securities regulation and lending activities.</li>

<li><strong>Annual compliance reviews must test actual practices, not merely policy documentation:</strong> Effective reviews include sampling credit approvals to verify committee procedures were followed, examining loan files for documentation completeness, testing fee calculations for accuracy, reviewing marketing materials for compliance approval, and interviewing personnel about their understanding of requirements, with findings documented in written reports presented to boards demonstrating program effectiveness.</li>

<li><strong>Regulatory landscape evolution requires continuous program adaptation:</strong> Credit fund compliance officers should monitor SEC examination priorities, risk alerts, and enforcement actions affecting credit strategies, participate in industry associations and conferences to understand peer practices and emerging risks, and update policies proactively as strategies expand, regulations develop, and industry standards evolve rather than waiting for examination findings to identify deficiencies.</li>
