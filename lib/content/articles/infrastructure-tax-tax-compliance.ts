  content: `<p>Infrastructure fund tax planning leverages substantial depreciation benefits from capital-intensive assets, structures investments to optimize tax efficiency across domestic and international holdings, manages partnership tax allocations over extended hold periods, addresses cross-border tax considerations for global infrastructure portfolios, and provides comprehensive investor tax reporting through K-1 preparation. Tax efficiency significantly affects net investor returns making sophisticated planning essential for competitive performance.</p>

<h2>Partnership Tax Structure and K-1 Preparation</h2>

<p>Infrastructure funds typically structure as partnerships providing flow-through taxation. Annual Form 1065 filing and K-1 preparation allocates income, deductions, and credits to partners. Extended hold periods create multi-year tax loss allocations from depreciation followed by gains upon exit requiring careful investor communication about tax timing. Institutional investors require timely K-1 delivery (March 15 or September with extensions) for their tax return preparation.</p>

<h2>Depreciation and Cost Segregation</h2>

<p>Infrastructure assets generate substantial tax depreciation given capital intensity. Cost segregation studies identify asset components eligible for accelerated depreciation including 5, 7, or 15-year property versus 27.5 or 39-year building lives. Bonus depreciation when available provides immediate expensing creating large tax losses benefiting investors. The tax team coordinates cost segregation studies at acquisition, models depreciation benefits versus costs, and tracks recapture obligations upon exit.</p>

<h2>International Tax Considerations</h2>

<p>Global infrastructure portfolios create cross-border tax complexity including foreign tax credits for taxes paid to foreign jurisdictions, treaty benefits reducing withholding on cross-border payments, GILTI inclusions for controlled foreign corporations, and PFIC considerations for certain foreign investment vehicles. Tax advisors structure international holdings optimizing tax efficiency while managing US investor reporting obligations. Blocker corporations may be used isolating foreign income for tax-exempt or foreign investors preferring simplified tax reporting.</p>

<h2>UBTI for Tax-Exempt Investors</h2>

<p>Debt-financed income creates UBTI for tax-exempt partners requiring Form 990-T filing. Given infrastructure's high leverage, UBTI often results unless structures isolate leverage through blockers. Tax advisors model UBTI impact during fundraising, disclose expected UBTI to tax-exempt prospects, and provide annual estimates supporting investor tax planning.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Depreciation creates substantial tax benefits:</strong> Capital-intensive infrastructure generates large depreciation deductions, with cost segregation accelerating benefits through shorter depreciable lives.</li>

<li><strong>Extended holds complicate tax planning:</strong> Multi-decade horizons create years of tax losses from depreciation followed by exit gains requiring investor communication about tax timing and character.</li>

<li><strong>International structures require careful planning:</strong> Cross-border holdings demand tax-efficient structuring managing foreign taxes, treaty benefits, and US reporting complexity.</li>

<li><strong>UBTI affects tax-exempt investors:</strong> High infrastructure leverage creates UBTI for tax-exempt partners unless mitigated through blocker structures or reduced leverage.</li>
