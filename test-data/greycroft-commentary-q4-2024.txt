GREYCROFT PARTNERS VII LP
Q4 2024 PARTNER COMMENTARY

Fund Name: Greycroft Partners VII LP
Reporting Period: Q4 2024
Prepared by: Investment Team

================================================================================
MARKET OVERVIEW
================================================================================

The fourth quarter of 2024 marked a notable inflection point for the venture capital ecosystem. After nearly two years of valuation compression and muted exit activity, we observed meaningful signs of recovery across multiple fronts. The IPO window, while not fully open, showed encouraging activity with several high-profile tech listings generating strong aftermarket performance.

The AI/ML infrastructure build-out continued at an unprecedented pace, with hyperscalers collectively deploying over $150 billion in capital expenditure during the year. This infrastructure investment is creating substantial tailwinds for our enterprise software portfolio companies, many of which are seeing accelerating demand for AI-enabled solutions.

Venture funding activity increased 18% quarter-over-quarter to $48 billion globally, though still 35% below the 2021 peak. More importantly, the quality of deals improved significantly, with investors demonstrating greater discipline around valuations and unit economics. Down rounds decreased 40% from Q3, suggesting valuations are finding firmer footing.
